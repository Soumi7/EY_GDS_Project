Class hierarchy rule summary  C120 Use class hierarchies to represent concepts with inherent hierarchical structure only  C121 If a base class is used as an interface make it a pure abstract class  C122 Use abstract classes as interfaces when complete separation of interface and implementation is needed Designing rules for classes in a hierarchy summary  C126 An abstract class typically doesnt need a constructor  C127 A class with a virtual function should have a virtual or protected destructor  C128 Virtual functions should specify exactly one of virtual override or final  C129 When designing a class hierarchy distinguish between implementation inheritance and interface inheritance  C130 For making deep copies of polymorphic classes prefer a virtual clone function instead of copy constructionassignment  C131 Avoid trivial getters and setters  C132 Dont make a function virtual without reason  C133 Avoid protected data  C134 Ensure all nonconst data members have the same access level  C135 Use multiple inheritance to represent multiple distinct interfaces  C136 Use multiple inheritance to represent the union of implementation attributes  C137 Use virtual bases to avoid overly general base classes  C138 Create an overload set for a derived class and its bases with using  C139 Use final on classes sparingly  C140 Do not provide different default arguments for a virtual function and an overrider Accessing objects in a hierarchy rule summary  C145 Access polymorphic objects through pointers and references  C146 Use dynamic_cast where class hierarchy navigation is unavoidable  C147 Use dynamic_cast to a reference type when failure to find the required class is considered an error  C148 Use dynamic_cast to a pointer type when failure to find the required class is considered a valid alternative  C149 Use unique_ptr or shared_ptr to avoid forgetting to delete objects created using new  C150 Use make_unique to construct objects owned by unique_ptrs  C151 Use make_shared to construct objects owned by shared_ptrs  C152 Never assign a pointer to an array of derived class objects to a pointer to its base  C153 Prefer virtual function to casting C120 Use class hierarchies to represent concepts with inherent hierarchical structure only Reason Direct representation of ideas in code eases comprehension and maintenance,Case Study
