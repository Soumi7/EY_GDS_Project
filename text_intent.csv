  Space travel has had a relatively short history. Despite its recency, the field has seen 
rapid development over the last several 
decades. Once the domain of governments, space travel 
is now also in the private sector. Since the first commercial human space flight took place in 

2001, several other wealthy space tourists purchased their rides into space. Currently, more than 

625  peop
le have signed up for sub
-orbital space flights with Virgin Galactic
 [1]
. However, there 
still are significant barriers in making space travel a reality for the general public. This paper 

examines and an
alyzes these problems 
and posits the problem of conventional propulsion system 
as the central issue to target. Buildi
ng upon these analyses, several alternative propulsion sources 

are discussed as new solutions. Additionally, presentation was performed in front of general 

public and surveys were conducted to 
assess
 the perceived accessibility of space travel to 

ordi
nary 
people. Results indicated 
the study participants
 indeed consider
ed space travel to be a 
personally feasible aspiration
 when the problems related to cost, 
safety
, and 
convenience
 were 
resolved.
     SPACE TRAVEL: HISTORY, CURRENT STATUS, PROBLEMS, AND 
FUTURE
 DIRECTIONS
 I. Introduction
  The human race has been always an adventurous pioneering species. 
At high risks
, we 
have gone out to explore unknown hostile places, and climbed over difficult mountains and 
hurdles while not having a clear idea what we might find
[2]
. Such risk taking pioneeri
ng spirits
, though at times
 costly, ultimately helped us to thrive and progress. Since the 1900s, air and space 
have been two of our biggest new frontiers. With raw passion, the legendary Wright brothers 

went through 4 years of 
mechanical aeronautical experimentation
s before sustain
ing their first 
powered and controlled flights in North Carolina in 1903
[3], [4]
. After their 
public 

demonstrat
ion of air flight
 in 1908 at the French Hunaudieres race course, 
another
 4 years passed 
before 39 countries came to 
possess
 hundreds of airplanes 
and numerous 
pilots
[2]
. Through 
subsequent 
efforts at birthing new ideas and 
testing them
, aviation
 technology was able to com
e to the point of mass producing the safe, cost
-effective airplanes that we fly today
[3]
. Unlike such 
incredible history of
 aviation
, the history of s
pace flight 
has not seen innovation for almost two 
generations
[2]
. Only recently has there been another wave of new movement in the progress of 
space travel, since the space aer
onautics industry got passed on from the hands of the 
government to the hands of the private sector. The privatization and commercialization of space 

travel has been a boon for the industry indeed, with exciting developments in new concepts and 

possibiliti
es[2], [5]
. However, many hurdles still stand in the way of making space travel a 
reality for the everyman. 
  Before expounding on the recent waves 
of innovation in space travel, it is important to 
acknowledge the lack of progress that had lasted for almost two generations. In fact, it is more 
accurate to state that we ha
d regressed during those years
[2]
. For example, in1998
, the U.S. Air 
Force retreated to jets that were developed in 1956, forgoing the mo
re impressive airplanes like 

the supersonic
 Lockheed SR
-71 that was designed in 1959, only 12 years after the first 
operational jet. The Concord jet had doubled the speed of commercial airplanes, but since its 

retirement, the new airliners being currently 
manufactured are again the same speed as the DC8 

planes in 1958. Likewise in space travel, the 1964 
Grumman Apollo Lunar Module
 was a superb 
craft designed to fly only in space, which could land on and take off from the moon without 

requiring much maintena
nce
[6]
. However, this was abandoned in 1972. The number of manned 
space flights has also decreased. During the first ye
ar of human space flight with Gagarin™s lead, 

there were 5 flights in total. In 2003, 
in the year that
 all of the crew members sent from the U.S. 
were killed, there were 3
 flights
; in 2004, there were only two Russian flights
[2], [7]
. Also, 40 
years after our first moon landing, no plans exist to return to the moon until 2020, until we build 

the capability to have sustained human presence on the moon
[8]
. Since th
e retirement of the 
Apollo and Saturn V programs, NASA™s rockets and space shuttles simply are not capable of 

going beyond low
-Earth orbit to reach the moon, especially with the amount of payload required 
for such prolonged expedition and semi
-permanent se
ttlement
[8], [9]
.  Although NASA is currently developing new taller and larger rockets 
Ares I
 and 
Ares V
 to return to the moon and even surpass it
[9]
 Œ perhaps to Mars
 Œ the goals for building cheaper, 
safer, stronger, faster rockets would require unprecedented amounts of creative innovati
on and 
investment.  
However, t
he fiscal challenges that face NASA have not 
been a trivial matter
. In fact, this has been pointed out as one of the main reasons for the lack of progress in the last few 
decades in space travel. (Another reason stems from the
 lack of compelling public motivation, 
unlike the national security concern that fueled support for the Cold War era™s space race with 

the Soviets.)
[8]
 Currently, NASA™s cost for the construction of the 
Orion
 and 
Ares I
 alone is $35 
billion, not counting other
 countless innovations that could and should take place in rocket 
science. Fortunately, recent privatization of the space industry has been, so far, a great antidote 

to the fiscal problem
[2], [10]
 . Just as getting a 20 million from several billionaire space tourism 
customers sustained the starving Russian space 
program, the commercial space flight industry is 

predicted to add riches to the resource
-poor space flight industry. Already more than 1.7 billion 
investments have occurred in private space flight industry by companies like Google, and that is 

only half of
 what is being committed and planned for the next few years. Soon, the investments 
are predicted to flow in at five times more than what NASA will be doing
 for human space flight 
by 2020
[2], [10], [11]
.  The pri
vate space flight industry is definitely increasing in volume with a lot of players 
rising to benefit from the profitable market for public sub
-orbital flights. To name a few, these 
players
 are Burt Rutan
 (Scaled Composites)
, Paul Allen, El
on Musk
 (SpaceX)
, Sir 
Richard 
Branson
 (Virgin Galactic)
, Jeff Bezos
 (Blue Origin)
, the Ansari family
 (Ansari X Prize)
, and 
Bob Bigelow
 (Bigelow Aerospace) 
, and 
David Thompson (Orbital Sciences)
[12]
Œ[14]
. Like the 
space race for prestige that took place between countries in the Cold War era, now these private 

companies a
re engaging in ﬁthe capitalist™s space raceﬂ to claim the honor of first reaching 

technological breakthroughs, as well as reaching the moon and beyond
[15]
. Great innovations 
have already taken place to address the problems of safety, cost, and convenience that had 

limited space flight, 
through the development of more fuel
-efficient and reusable rockets, better
 propulsion mechanisms, including 
solar sails
. This paper will discuss in detail 
these advances as 
well as more promising hypothetical alternatives 
in the later sections. 
It also aims to target the 
problem of public buy
-in by adding a
n intervention
 researc
h component: educational seminar 
was administered to a group of diverse adults to increase their levels of awareness and sense of 
relevance in regards to space travel. All in all, w
ith safer and cheaper options becoming available 
to offer even elliptical o
rbit trips around the moon like 
Apollo 8
, it is believed that about 100,000 
people will fly by 2020
[2]
. Not only that, more excitements are now on the horizon, such as 
settlement on the moon, colonization of Mars, and intergalactic travel
[2], [11]
.   II. Background
 A. History of Space Travel
 1. History of Rocketry
  The outer space has been an object of fancy, 
inspiration
, and study from 
ancient
 times. 
Looking into the magnificent sky and its stars, people have wondered what lies beyond them 
and 
whether they could reach the 
other side. With the development of the telescope in 
1609 by 
Galileo Galilei
, people were able to see the universe in more detail and to find out the principles 

of the cosmos. People discovered that the Earth was not the center of the universe, and that th
ere 

were other planets orbiting around the sun with their 
own moons orbiting around them
[16]
. The 
Earth
™s moon
 is the closest 
celestial
 object to us, and it no longer appeared to be so out of reach 
in comparison to the vast universe
[7]
. In 1903 
the Wright Brothers succeeded 
in flying their 
aircraft and fueled the human zeal for air travel more:
 if powerful machinery could take us up 
into high skies, could
n™t 
there be machinery
 develop
ed to take us up even to the moon?
 The 
Chinese fireworks, 
which
 used gun powder to create 
explosive propulsion
, became the 
inspiration
 for the modern rockets. 
In same centu
ry, 
first 
rockets 
Œ or 
ﬁrocce
ﬂ in Old Italian for a 
long, thin tube 
Œ appeared in Europe as crude weapons for war. 
Though still limited in size, 
performance, and safety, propulsion charges from 
black powder (
finely ground charcoal), 
potassium nitrate, and sulfur
 provided enough power to demonstrate the 
promis
ing
 future of 
rockets. 
Military rockets eventually increased in size and performance with 
continual refinement 

of the technology.
 Contributing to rocket development as serious science was Sir Isaac Newton
™s formulation of the laws of
 gravity and motion. Th
ese laws, clearly described in Newton
™s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,
 are still 
used 
today
 to 
explain 
in detail 
how 
rockets and propulsion
 work
[17]
  Near the beginning of the 20
th century, 
the crude 
gunpowder rockets lost their 
signi
ficance as weapons and modern rocket science began. 
There are three men who are called 
ﬁFathers of Modern Rocketry.
ﬂ Among them, the
 first person who 
researched rockets for the 
purpose of space travel was a former school teacher from Russia, named 
Konstant
in Tsiolkovsky
. He 
discovered the concept of exhaust velocity, which means that the greater the explosion of the 
fuel, the greater the thrust velocity. Tsiolkovsky 
wrote many articles about the principles and 
theoretical aspects of spaceflight. His work gr
eatly influenced space and rocket research in 
USSR and Europe
[16], [17]
. In the United States, Robert Goddard
 found through his 
experiments that rockets could fly in a vacuum. Not only do they fly well in a vacuum, Goddard 

discovered that th
e rockets fly at even faster speeds 
in vac
uum than in air, because vacuum does 
not have air resistance to reduce the rocket
™s thrust. Goddard
 also
 became the first person to 
dev
elop liquid
-fuel 
for 
rockets,
 which were evidently more efficient than solid fu
el despite some 
of its disadvantages (e.g. harder to handle, must be kept in separate tanks, and in very low 

temperatures of 
-300ºF)[16], [17]
. Goddard
 launched his first rocket in
 Auburn, Massachusetts in 
1926 and continued to build 
engines
 and more complex rockets
 into his later life
 in New Mexico.
 Lastly, Hermann Oberth
 studied the requirements for interplanetary travel. He also
 was 
instrumental 
in promoting rocket science through 
his paper called, 
ﬁBy Rocket into Planetary 
Space,
ﬂ which r
eferenced Godd
ard™
s work to present space travel as more of real science than 
just science fiction. It is said that by reading Ober
th™
s paper Tsiolkovsky became incited to 
publish his own work and new theories
[16], [17]
.  2. History of Human
 Space Travel
  Thanks to the pioneering work of the abovementioned Fathers of Modern Rocketry, the
 science of space travel 
has long reached a level where trained astronauts could travel into space.
 After the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellit
e Sputnik
 into orbit 
in October 1957, 
Sputnik 2
 soon followed a month later, this time carrying the first animal into space. Though the 
first dog Laika only survived for 4 hours in space due to malfunctioning environmental control 

system, 13 other dogs and
 animals were successfully sent and safely returned to Earth before the 

first human flight
[17], [18]
. With the Soviet successes in space, the United States joined in 
competition and started the oft
-called space race between the two countries. President 
Eisenhower instituted the National Aer
onautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 to 
engage more fully in the goal to send human beings into space. 
Besides this main goal, NASA 

sent probes to explore the earth
™s space environment: 
the 
moon and other planets, as well as the 
sun and stars
[16]
. In the same year, 
Project 
Mercury 
was created with the sole purpose of 
sending Americans into the outer space
, on orbital
 flights
. Starting from the year 1961,
 the 
Project trained and sent 7 young pilots who became the nation
™s first astronauts. 
Although the
 Project had hope
d that one of 
these 7 would become the first man in space, i
n April
 1961, Yuri 
Gagarin of Soviet Union 
claimed the honor 
Œ just a few weeks before the U.S.
™s Alan Shep
ard 
went into space in May 1961
[19]
.  Yuri Gagarin 
thus 
beca
me the first human to be in
 sub
-orbital 
space
, flying in the 
spacecraft 
Vostok
. Despite the concer
ns over the negative health effects of weightlessness, 
Gagarin returned unharmed
 and functioned normally. Valentina Tereshkova soon became the 

first woman to be in space for 3 days on 
Vostok 6
 in 1963. 
 These
 success
es of 
Vostok
 missions 
were
 followed by i
mprovements to the 
spacecraft 
that would enable 
even travel around 
the 
moon
[18]
. This new generation of spaceships was called 
Voskhod, 
and it became the first multi
-person spacecraft, carrying 3 cosmonauts crammed into the cabin designed for one
. On 
Voskhod 
2, Alexei
 Leonov 
then became the first man to make a 
space
walk that last
ed for about 12 minutes
 in 1965
. However, the 
Voskhod
 missions were discontinued when the Soviet Union decided to 
focus its energies on the moon race with the United States
[19]
.   The 
competition between 
Soviet Union and United States on 
striving to reach the moon 
fir
st was a fierce one. 
Former President John F. Kenn
edy
 even 
presented this issue in a 
ﬁSpecial 
Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs,
ﬂ urging the Congress to quickly create a 
space program rivaling the Soviets
[20]
. Thus, in 1961, in the midst of the Cold War, the U.S. 
created the Apollo program with the aim to reach the moon by the end of the decad
e. 
After 
several successful orbiting around the moon, United States finally had Neil Armstrong land on 

the surface of the moon through 
Apollo 11 
in 1969. 
This feat was accomplished by building and 

launching
 two separate space crafts
, Apollo and Saturn V,
 in order to cover the long distance to 
the moon
. Saturn V, 
one of the largest rockets ever flown successfully, took 
Apollo
 half wa
y to 
the moon then launched it into the lunar trajectory
.  The 6 teams of astronauts sent through the 
Apollo program landed suc
cessfully on the moon and collected data on observations and 
experiments, and brought samples of the lunar dust and rocks
[19]
.   The next challenge for the 
aeronautical
 community was forging an international 
collaboration, leaving behind the era of 
international competition 
between the U.S. and 
the 

Soviet Union. 
In 1975, the
y had 
Apollo
-Soyuz
 Test Project
 as the 
first international
 space 
mission. Soyuz spacecraft launched from the center in Central Asia, and Apollo from the 

Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The two crew teams met in orbit and visited each other
™s space crafts
[21]
. This paved the way for the future ventures, including the se
nding of U.S. space 
missions to the Ru
ssian Mir space station
. European nations also joined in this international trend 
by creating a European Space Agency (ESA) in the same year of 1975. These 15 nations were: 

Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, G
ermany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, 
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The ESA participated in many 
solar system missions, with a large budget reaching 3.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2003
[21]
. The 
active 
international
 space 
collaboration
 is well exemplified in the establishment of the 
International Space Station, which now 
orbits the Earth as the largest artificial object in space as 
well as the habitat of longest human presence in space (13 years). ISS was created as a 
merger of 

three space station projects 
in 1993, with 
components for
 Russian Mir
-2, American Freedom, 
European Columbus
 space station 
program
s. In this
 microgravity and space research 
environment
, astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations
 have visited and conducted 
various experiments
. Finally, in 2003 China became
 the third nation to launch a human into 
space, aboard 
the 
Shenzhou
 5.  China had been involved in space travel projects discretely since 

1940s; 
in 1992 China made its own space 
program
 with the help from Russian experts. 
China
™s own space station, Tiangon
g, was finally launched into space in 2011
[22]
.   However, 
the hist
ory of space travel was not without tragedy. There were several 
accidents that cost lives
 and caused a lot of media coverage and international upheaval
. In 1967, 
for example, 
Vladimir Komarov 
of Soviet Union 
died in a crash of 
Soyuz 1
 due to 
a series of 
technical issues, 
including
 parachute failure after re
-entry into the Earth
™s atmosphere. 
As 
Komaro
v™s death was the first to occur during space flight, the tragic incident spurred the 
development of improvements in spaceship design
[23]
. In the United States, t
he 
Challenger
 space shuttle exploded 
in 1986 
after 73 seconds into its flight, killing 7 crew members. In 

reaction to this tragedy, the 
U.S. 
space 
program
 was 
grounded
 for 32 months, as the public and 
program 
questioned
 and
 weighed the 
safety
 of space flight
[2], [23], [24]
. After the Ch
allenger 
accident, 
further launches were prohibited for 
any 
vehicle loaded
 with commercial
 payload. As 
commercial launches were prohibited for the U.S. government space program, this instigated the 
development of private sector space exploration companies.
 As of 2013, 
he 
last recorded 
space 
casualty occurred in 2003 with the space shuttle 
Columbia
, which
 disintegrated with its 7 crew 
members while re
-entering 
the Earth 
after 
a 2-week mission, due to structural failures after 
encountering problems in its the
rmal protection system
[23]
.   In total, 
18 out 
of the 430 humans who 
flew 
in space have died, 14 on two shuttle 
missions and four on two Soyuz flights. 
This is equivalent to the 
fatality rate o
f 4.19 percent, 
though
 the rate i
s somewhat inflated by counting those who have flown on multiple flights
. Compared to other adventures, 
this
 rate is 
similar to the
 one for climbing Mt. Everest. 
However, 
Rich 
Hauck,
 a former astronaut and CEO of 
AXA Space, a leading space insurance compan
y, 
believes
 the risk of death needs to be decreased 
before 
public space travel
 becomes
 widely 
accepted. 
In order for the public feel safe enough to travel to space, the fatality rate should be 
reduced to less than 1 percent, Hauck said. As a reference, tha
t is 
about the same
 percent risk that
 the typical American 
encounters during one
™s lifetime, 
dying in an ordinary traffic accident
[24]
.  3. History of Space Shuttles
  NASA has been planning to build a reusable spaceship beginning in the 1960s. 
In 1972, 
the Congress gave NASA the permission to start the shuttle program.
[25]
 Due to budget 
constraints, however, NASA cut the development costs through combining the use of reusable 

and throw
-away elements in the shuttle design
[25]
. Big wing span as big as a mid
-sized 
passenger airplane, and capacity for up
 to 8 astronauts.
 It had several main areas, namely t
he 
crew cabin, cargo bay, and 
liquid fuel for rocket engines
 that enable the 
launch and maneuver 
of 
the shuttle in space, as well as 
its 
return to Earth
. Among its protection system, the most 
important is the thermal pro
tection system to protect the shuttle from intensive heat during the 
re-entering of the Earth
™s atmosphere.
 These orbiter s
huttles are designed to land on the runway 
of the Kennedy Space Center, gliding in its final moments as an unpowered glider. 
They mad
e five of these shuttles: 
Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Endeavour, 
and
 Atlantis
[26]
.  From its first flight in 1981, space shuttles have flown many different 
missions
. For 
example, the space shuttle 
Columbia
 flew 28 missions, before disintegrating during its re
-entry 
after its last mission
[26]
. The shuttles
™ missions included deploying satellites,
 capturing 
the
m in 
orbit for 
repair
, and returning them
 to earth; leading
 many scientific experiments, such as the 
study of how 
weightlessness affects living organi
sms
; and becoming observational sites for 
studying the heavenly bodies of the universe. 
Perhaps the most 
crucial 
mission of the U.S. space 
shuttle 
was the launching of the
 famous
 Hubble Telescope by 
Discovery
 in 1990. 
The shuttles 
even flew secret missions for the Departments of Defense, and played crucial roles in 

constructing the ISS
[26]
. Despite its versatility and reusablity, the space shuttle program has 
largely failed in reducing the costs of human space flight. Becaus
e of its complexity, the shuttle
 required 
lots of maintenance between each mission; and after its risk was underscored after two 
shuttles crashed and killed all of its crew members, the shuttle progra
m was stopped in 2011
[26]
. B. Current Status of Space Travel
 1. Space tourism
 Today, 
new kinds 
of 
space travel are emerging. The year 2001
 marked the beginning of 
space tourism, as a wealthy California businessman, Dennis Tito, 
became the 
first paying 
passenger
 for space flight
[27]
. He
 paid $20 million 
to be launched by 
Soyuz
 TM-32 via 
arrangements made 
between an
 American 
company called 
Space Adventures
 and a
 Russian 
company
 MirCorp
, which oversaw the
 Mir
 space station. 
The ticket sale was to fund
 the 
maintenance of the
 Mir 
space station
; however
, a premature
 deorbit decision diverted
 Tito
™s destination
 to the ISS. 
For 8 days, Tito enjoyed a unique vacation 
in 
orbit 
and 
spent
 seven days 
on board the ISS
[27], [28]
.  Initially, there were many controv
ersies in NASA in regards to the 
possible delays that such tourism would cause for the scheduled work. However, the concerns 
proved to be unfounded as no delays were experienced
[28]
.  Many other laypersons followed 
Tito
™s footsteps: Mark Shuttleworth, a South African technology entrepreneur in 2002; Gregory 
Olsen, an American e
ntrepreneur
-engineer
-scientist in 2005; Anousheh Ansari, an Iranian 
American businesswoman in 2006; and 
several
 other wealthy persons
[27]
. Given the 
orbital
 nature of these flights, most of these 
commercial space tr
avelers
 needed to go through
 arduous 
training
 for their missions, alongside p
rofessional 
astronauts
. However, several private 
companies are developing 
suborbital 
space vehicles 
to commercialize
 space travel, 
which would 
take
 passengers to an altitude of 100 km (62 miles)
[27]
. In the coming years
, it is expected that 
such 
suborbital
 space
 tourism 
will become more 
aff
ordable
, safer
, and easier
 for a wider range of 
customers 
[28]
.  In 200
4, a concrete step towards realizing suborbital space tourism was achieved. 
During 
the 
$10 million
 Ansari X Prize
 challenge
, private companies 
competed
 with
 each other
 to 
launch 
a reusable manned spacecraft
 twice within two weeks
[27]
.  On Oct
ober
 4, 2004, Virgin Galactic 
and B
urt Rutan of 
Scaled Composites
 won the X Prize 
with their 
successful
 SpaceShipOne
 and 
opened the new era of 
commercial manned spaceflight
. In the same year, 
U.S. Commercial 
Space Launch Amendments Act (CSLAA) 
was instituted to have 
Federal Aviation 

Administration (FAA)
 regulat
e the
 safety of commercial human spaceflight in 
the U.S. 
Under 
this Act, 
every
 commercial space
 launch
, landing, and operation will be attended and evaluated 
by FAA representatives; 
all
 spaceflight participants
 will also be guided through an inform
ed 
consent process,
 in writing
, about 
the risks of launch and reentry
, including the 
safety record of 
the launch vehicle
[27]
.  Although these safety regulations are still in their 
early stage
s of 
development
 and 
implementation
, Sir Richard Branson™
s Virgin Galactic has 
already sold
 more th
an 
625 seats at 
$200,000 per ticket
 for its 
2.5-hour 
suborbital space tourism 
flights
 on SpaceShipTwo
[1], [29], 
[30]
. SpaceShipTwo
 was officia
lly disclosed to the public 
in Dece
mber
, 2009 
in California
 and is 
tentatively
 scheduled 
start its operations in
 2014[30]
. The 
official dat
e for the inaugural launch
 has been never been set, but the tentative start date has been delayed since 2007 due to Virgi
n Galactic
™s rigorous safety testing. With a new former Air Force pilot joined, 
spaceport
 opened, 
commercial 
space system 
license
 applied
 for, 
and 
powered test flight 
successfully performed in 
2013, however, Virgin Galactic is confident that their customer
s™ trust them to launch when it is 
truly safe to do so
[1], [29]
. When that time comes, 
SpaceShipTwo 
will be
 carried to launch 
altitude
 (15.25 km)
 by a jet
-powered mothership, the Scaled Composites
™ White Knight Two
, before 
turning up its roc
ket engines to 
fly 
up to 110 km in 
the upper atmosphere
. The
 passengers 
will feel about
 5 minutes of weightlessness
 as they get amazing views of the planet Earth. The 
spacecraft will
 stabilize
 itself for reentry through 
ﬁfeathering
ﬂ the wings, 
then glide b
ack to Earth 
for
 a conventional runway landing
[27], [30]
.   Currently,
 Virgin Galactic
 remains as the 
only
 private space tourism company that 
successfully
 air
-launched
 its SpaceShipTwo
 vehicle
[12]
. However,
 Virgin 
Galactic
 is definitely
 not alone 
in its venture into 
space tourism
, as it is being seen as lucrative 
industry 
for the
 upcoming many decades
[2], [12], [13]
. For example, 
SpaceDev/Sierra Ne
vada Cor
poration has 
its reusable space plane
 Dream Chaser
 under development, which would take up to 
4 passengers 
on suborbital flights
[12]
.  Astri
um, 
a subsidiary of 
European Aeronautic Defen
se and Space 
Company, announced its spac
e tourism project in 2007
 and started to develop its 
rocket plane
 Mach 3
 in 2008. 
Mach 3
™s $250,000 price tag
 will include
 spaceflight participant training, luxury 
resort 
accommodation, 
as well as a round
-trip to the spaceport. The 
California
-based 
XCOR 
Aerospace
 also revealed its smaller 
suborbital space
craft
 Lynx 
in 2008
, designed to carry a pilot 
and a single passenger at a time. Its 
$95,000 ticket includes 
pre
-flight tr
aining sessions
, and is 
scheduled to start providing flights
 by 2014
. The price is significantly lower than the competitors
, in order
 to make commercial spaceflight
 more accessible to the public
. XCOR
 already has
 over 
175 reservations
[27], [31]
. Among these 
suborbital
 space tourism companies, Texas
-based 
company 
Blue Origin
™s New Shepard
 spacecraft 
is also 
distinct 
from its peers, due to 
its vertical 
take
-off and land
ing design. 
Supported by a 
$22 million 
grant from NASA, 
New Shepard
 boasts 
its 
innovative biconic shape
 that 
ﬁprovides greater cross
-range and interior volume than 
traditional capsules without the weight penalty of winged spacecraft
 (p. 1)
ﬂ[32]
 In addition, the 
spacec
raft features a 
ﬁpusher escape systemﬂ
 that 
allow
s the 
crew 
to 
escape in an emergency 
situation 
during any phase of ascent 
into
 suborbital
 flight. 
 Rob Meyerson, president and program 
manager of Blue Origin
, stated that
 ﬁproviding crew escape without the n
eed to jettison the 
unused escape system gets us closer to our goal of safe an
d affordable human spaceflight
 (p.1)
ﬂ[33]
 These
 develop
ments in commercial 
suborbital
 spacecrafts are the fruit of human 
creati
vity and passion that persisted in the face of
 formidable technical challenges and 
financial 
constraints
. Although still limited to suborbital flights within the confines of the Earth
™s gravity
, it is predicted that the growth of this industry sector 
will not only profit companies, but also 
provide the impetus for further progress in human space flight beyond the moon,
 Mars
, and 
the 
Milky Way 
galaxy. 
 2. Private companies
 One of the 
significant
 changes in the U.S. that gave way to the flurry of develop
ment in 
commercial 
human space travel is the 
privatization
 of NASA
™s Space Shuttle Program (SSP)
[34]
.  This
 change
 in NASA 
is a
 significant departure
 from its 
management
 by opening up the s
pace 
shuttle operations
 to private industries
 [33]
. However, what characterizes this merger 
is not a
 simple
 handover of 
government functions t
o private compan
ies. NASA has taken car
eful 
measures to 
provid
e the 
companies with 
necessary skills and experience
 to ensure a 
successful
, strong partnership
. Likewise, NASA has examined its 
own organizational integrity, s
o that it 
would not continue to rely primarily on outside contracts for i
mportant skill and experience
-based functions due to a huge loss of 
their own workforce. 
 In privatizing the 
SSP, implementing 
str
ong check and balance processes
 has been 
paramount. 
 Without such stringent control processes among the numerous new players i
n the 
SSP, pr
ocess drift
 or 
creep 
can easily affect the quality 
of hardware
; organizational 
factors such 
as 
personnel change 
or turnover 
can result in 
critical loss of skills 
transferred
 for con
tinual 
progress of the program
[34]
. As an illustration, the 
NASA SSP civil service workforce
 was 
reduced by half since 1993, causing t
he NASA skill base to diminish. 
As mentione
d previously, 
NASA has therefore put in measures to prevent detrimental losses of skills and talent 
in its 
workforce. 
Secondly, 
NASA has given the private companies and astronauts a level of 

ownership for safety and mission decisions, to increase the stren
gth o
f the check and balance 
system; in other words, the
 healthy tension  
between NASA and private companies and 
individuals will elicit more 
challeng
es to the 
ﬁassumptions 
of 
test results, procedures, processes, 
problem disposition recommendations, and pl
anned work
 (p.1)
ﬂ [34]
. C. Problems, 
Limitations
, and Possible Solutions
 1. Safety
 and Convenience
 a) Space Junk
 One of the
 major safety concerns for space travel, perhaps surprisingly, 
has to do with 
the 
space
 debris that we have created since 
the 1960s
[35]
. Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist at 
NASA™s Orbital Debris Program Office
, stated that orbiting space 
debris
 have increased linearly
 since 1960s
 (see 
Figure 1
), even with the
 technological 
advances 
that 
decreas
ed the amount of 
debris 
left in
 each 
space
 flight
[36]
. Currently, it is
 estimate
d that 
there ar
e approximately
 30,000 items
 of junk
 bigger than
 10cm
 in diameter orbiting
 around the Earth,
 at speeds higher than 
465m/
sec 
[37]
. Because of 
such 
high traveling speeds of
 space 
debris,
 even pieces smaller than 
10cm 
can penetrate and damage most spacecraft
 or space suit
. In fact, NASA has calculated that 
a 10cm
-long piece of space 
debris
 can cause as much damage as 
25 sticks of d
ynamite
[38]
.  This cadre of space
 junk includes
 whole sate
llites
, rocket bodies, 
and
 fragments
 from 
explosions in fuel tanks
 and 
batteries, 
as well
 as f
rom the 
colossal
 impacts between objects
[36]
. For example, a 
Chinese missile test on a satellite 
caused a significant increase in the 
amount
 of 
space debris, as the missile collided with 
two
 orbiting
 satellites
. Expert
s noted that this incident 
alone had 
increased the risk 
for
 the 
2009 shuttle mission to
 the
 Hubble Space Telescope by 8 
percent
[36]
; it is also known that 
NASA needs to replace several windows
 on their satellites
 every year due to 
collisions with space debris 
[39]
[38]
. To be more exact, during
 NASA
™s 54 shuttle 
missions, space 
debris
 and meteoroids 
struck
 the 
windows 1,634 times
, and 
necessita
ted
 92 window replacements
;  the radiator was hit 317 times, 
creating
 holes in the radia
tor™s external 
body 
53 times
[36]
.   Figure 1. Growing 
populace of s
pace
 debris
 (NASA, 2009)
 With the 
accura
cy of a 
four
-day forecast
, NASA does t
rack
 with radar 
pieces of debris
 and
 meteoroids larger than 
10cm to
 identify 
impending collision
 dange
r, 
and then
 make
s an 
evasive maneuver 
to move space vehicles 
out of harm™s way
[36]
. NASA estimates that it has had 
to conduct around 
one collision avoidance maneuver
 per year
 for its s
huttle
s and IS
S. However,
 some difficulty exists in that the
 ISS generally needs 30 hours of advance notice to be 
maneuvered, and that 
several 
tens of thousands 
of 
smaller 
pieces
 move 
undetected 
and 
cause 
har
m [36]
. With this growing problem of space debris, a larg
er systemic effort was begun i
n 1995 by 
NASA
, which 
issue
d the first
 comprehensive
 set of
 guidelines 
for
 orbital debris 
mitigation
 in the 
world
. This became the basis for the 
U.S.
 governmen
t™s issuance of its 
Orbital 
Debris Mitigation Standard Practices
 2 years later
[40]
. Other countries and organizations
 soon 
followed with 
their own
 guidelines
; the efforts culminated in the establishment of
 the 
Inter
-Agency Space Debris
 Coordination Committee (IADC)
 in 2002, with space agencies from more 
than 
10 countries
 as members. Since F
ebruary
, 2007
 the 
United Nations
 has also joined the effort 
through 
the United Nation
s™ Committee on the Peacef
ul Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS
). 
Together, these member countries and guidelines
 are now working to 
prevent
 the creation of new 
debris, 
to 
design
 satellites to withstand
 small debris collision
, and 
to 
impl
ement
 operational 
procedures
, such as 
inspecting 
a space
craft before re
-entry
 to increase the 
chance
 of 
safety
 in 
case of collision (e.g. rescue of crew by another spacecraft)
[36], [40]
. More recently proposed 
solutions to the space debris issue include developing specialized 
bulldozer
-like spacecrafts that 
could catch and forcibly deorbit the pieces of deb
ris
[37]
.  b) Sustaining Life 
during
 Space Exploration
 Meeting basic human needs, such as 
food, water, air and adequate shelter
, is a challenge 
in spa
ce. First, s
pace 
travelers
 must 
transport their own nourishment and materials
 with them
, as 
there are no other known environments in outer space that an sustain human life
[41], [42]
. In 
terms of food,
 a typical 
astronaut on the ISS uses 
a food ration of 
about 0.83 k
g per meal each 
day, with 
0.12 kg of the
 weight 
being
 packaging ma
terial
. For a
 3-year round 
trip to Mars
, thousands of kilograms of food
 would then be needed: a c
rew of 
four will need to carry 
10,886 kg of food
 with them to space
[42]
. In the early years, even the food that astronauts could carry 
were 
unappetizing and hard to eat
, as largely 
same methods
 of food preparation and preservation
 were still
 used 
as the 
early 
sailing 
explorers
. To be able to
 store food onboard 
space shuttl
es and 
ISS
, astronauts were provided with 
freeze
-dried powders, bite
-size cubes
, and semi
-liquids in 
tubes
[42]
. These problems have been addressed by increasing the k
nowledge of the 
space 
environmen
t and developing 
better ways to prepare and package foods. Today, the types of 
available
 foods 
have become
 more varied through using techniques such as dehydration,
 temperature
-stabiliz
ation
, or irradiat
ion, and can be 
made
 ready to eat by
 just
 adding water or 
hea
t [42]
.  Second, the amount of water that can be transported into space is limited due to its 
weight
[43]
.  Therefore, space shuttles 
are usually designed to produce their own water through 
using 
fuel cells
 that combine 
hydrogen and oxygen
 atoms. When these atoms are combined, 
they 
produce 
electricity as well
 as 
water
; the water produced by thi
s process is then
 recycled and used 
by the 
crew
[44]
. Onboard crafts that pro
duce electricity from solar panels (e.g. ISS), s
mall 
amounts of wa
ter are recycled from cabin air
. Hence, while an
 average American uses about 132 
liters of water 
per
 day
, the astronauts 
onboard the ISS must 
limit their 
water use to about 
11 liters
 per day
[43]
. The problem of air, however, is not resolved by the presence of oxygen for the fuel 
cell, as the human body is
 tuned to the Earth
™s atmosphere, with its particular composition of 
different gases
[41]
. Among the 1.47 psi of atmospheric pressure, 21 percent or 3psi of it is 
oxygen 
Œ more than that would be toxic to the body. Nitrogen needs to make up about 78 percent 
or 11.5psi of air in order to dilute the oxygen
 content, and carbon dioxide must be continually 
removed from the body to prevent asphyxiation. The correct composition of such breathable air 
must be artificially maintained for all crafts, suits, and habitats in space to sustain human life
[45]
.  Thirdly, 
the p
roblem of shelter 
can be
 a major 
hazard for space travel. 
Proper s
helter is 
crucial
 in many aspect
s, including air pressure, temperature, and protection from collision. 
Even 
a tiny hole or crack can cause air pressure to decrease sharply, while leaking the
 mixture of air 
that is 
critical
 to survival
[41]
. On the return of Soyu
z 11 in 1971, three cosmonauts died 
from 
asphyxiation 
due to a small hole 
in the spacecraft
™s air valve
 that was only 1/16 in diameter. 
When the drop in air pressure does not go to a lethally low level, the dysbarism occurs as the 

nitrogen in the blood bub
bles throughout the circulatory system. Pain, fainting, 
difficul
ty 
breathing 
would
 result, and eventually lead one to death
[41]
. Temperature control is also critical, 
as overheating would cause heat
-related illnesses and death (e.g. heat stroke) and lack of heat 
would cause 
hypothermia
 and death, 
if no interventions are made
[41]
.  One of the 
great ways to be protected from these extreme space co
nditions is to use well
-designed space suits. The space suit provides breathable air, suitable temperature, moisture,
 pressure,
 odor and waste gas removal, as well as 
shelter from radiation and debris
[41]
. However, 
the conventional soft space suits have had their limitations. Because having the normal 

atmospheric pressure (i.
e. 14.7 psi) inside the space suit caused it to balloon out and disable the 
individual from executing flexible movements, the astronauts needed to go through an 

adjustment process 
for several hours to become acclimated to
 just 3psi of oxygen in the space 

suit. This was accomplished by having 
the individual breathe pure 
oxygen
 and have the nitrogen 
leave their blood through their lungs. While this process has been effective, its time requirement 

posed a major limitation in case of emergencies. 
The new space 
suits in development improves 

on the
se limitations 
by providing 
the regular atmospheric 
air pressure 
in rigid exoskeletons
 with 
flexible joints
[41]
.  c) Exoskeletons
 With the recently developed
 assistive 
machines and robots
, human beings can be less 
prone to weakness in extreme environments and conditions, such as the space envi
ronment and 
age
-related conditions.
 In the early years of space travel, passengers needed to go through harsh 
and rigorous training alongside professional astronauts, in order to get acclimated to the 
extreme
 
environmental changes in space. However, b
y com
bining 
human 
strength
 with that of robots, 
greater 
strength, speed, 
endurance, and adaptation can be achieved. 
In other words, exoskeletons 
will allow for h
uman 
intelligence and creativity 
to stay in 
command
, making use of their copious 
past experiences 
for dealing with various complex situations and 
emergenc
ies
[46]
. At the same 
time, the constant micro environment provided by the exoskeleton can protect human capacities
 from
 extreme 
pressure
s, temperatu
res, radiation, or collision
 in space. 
This means that lay people 
would be able to travel into space without as much training by simply wearing the exoskeleton.
 It 
will also enable space travel for those who are in less than optimal health conditions, for 
example 
due to their age. 
Indeed, t
he 
strength and speed 
offered by robotic exoskeletons will enable space 
travelers
 to avoid asteroids, space debris, and other obstacles 
easily
, thereby ameliorating some 
of the anxieties about accidents that could happen 
in space. With the growing market for space 
tourism, custom designed and 
versatile exoskeleton
s will be able to 
effective
ly meet the 
customer
™s taste, 
health conditions, and preferences
, the suit 
should 
also be and customizable. 
 2. Cost
 a) Cost of Conventional 
Rockets
  Space travel has been generally perceived to be an expensive venture
, and it 
has been 
certainly true. The cost
 of building and launching a rocket through a space program 
remains
 exorbitantly high, sometimes costing space program
 $2.1 billion
[47]
, in this case 
for 
NASA
™S Ares
 I program. With such a high cost to 
developing
 and constructing a 
spacecraft
, the costs 
inevitably trickle down to the
 price of a 
tourism
 passenger
 ticket
. As mentioned 
briefly in 
pre
vious sections
, the first 
space 
tourist passenger 
Tito paid 
$20 million
 to get onboard the 
Soyuz
 rocket 
(see Section B1). 
In the current state of 
technology
, every launch of a space shuttle 
costs 
between 
$500 and
 $700 million
; the cost of launching 
a pound
 of mass into a low
-earth orbit is 
about $10,000
[48]
. The space station costs 
more than
 $100 billion
 [48]
, which may increase as 
agencies 
attempt to 
make
 more habitable 
space stations 
for a larger 
commercial 
audie
nce. The 
char
t below descr
ibes
 the costs involved in different types of space 
and near
-space 
flights. 
Higher orbital flights evidently require much longer periods of training and are 
about 250
-500 times 
more costly
 than suborbital flights
.  Table
 1. Space
-related tourism experiences 
(Lubin, 2012
) b) Cost
-reducing 
Reusable 
Chemical Rockets
  Fortunately, t
here are many surprising ways to cut down 
the cost of building a rocket
 while still remaining in the conventional realm, meaning that conventional liquid and sol
id fuels 
are used for thrust. In fact, progress made by the private space companies has been able to cut 
down the cost 
by 75 percent,
 although the exact percentage
 depend
s on how 
it is 
calculate
d[11]
. These 
advances in the technology 
have been made for virtually every component of 
the
 rocket, 
including 
the airframe, engines, electronics
, and launch operation. 
These 
innovations
, most of 
them not patented, ultimately all advance the conc
ept making rockets reusable
[7]
. Although t
he 
space shuttle
s had been created as 
an attempt at 
this, their 
main tank
s still had to b
e thrown away
 at each flight
, and the 
reusable 
parts 
required 9 months for a team of 
10,000 people 
to refurbish 
them 
Œ totaling
 to a 
cos
t of 
billion dollars per flight
[11]
.  Therefore,
 Elon Musk and his company 
of Space X have been devising ways to have 
the rocket stages
 return 
intact 
to the launch site and 
be ready 
for another launch 
within 
a few 
hours. 
In their 
Grasshopper Test Project, 
engineers at 
Space X have been 
testing vertical 
landing 
for the terminal portion of the flight, by enabling the 

rocket to 
adjust
 its 
angle
, the 
pitch and yaw of the main engine, and 
to 
maintain
 roll with coal gas 
thrusters.
 Recently, they were able to have a 
rocket
 that was 
the size of a 12
-story buildi
ng to 
hover at about 40 meters, and 
return to its landing position
[11]
. This relatively simple concept of 
making the 
rocket itself 
more reusable can improve 
the cost of spaceflight 
roughly 100
-fold
, as 
the 
cost of the fuel
 only makes up a
bout .3 percent of the
 total
 cost of the rocket
. Moreover, 
advances in building rockets with
 significantly lighter, but stronger material 
would further 
decrease the costs for spaceflight, as 
it would m
ake its
 energy
 use as
 efficient
 as possible
[11]
.  III.
 Problems with 
Conventional
 Propulsion
s and
 Alternative Solutions
 A. Conventional 
Chemical Rockets
 There are currently three different typ
es of rockets that use solid, liquid, 
or 
hybrid fuels
 [49]
. The commonality among the three types is that they all use a propellant to thrust the rocket 
forward. Propellants are chemical mixtures of a
 type of
 fuel and oxygen, which burn upon 
contact.
 a) Solid
 propellant
 Solid propellant rockets are the most primitive form 
of rockets. 
Solid rockets were invented 
much
 before liquid 
propellant rockets, 
and this includes
 the ancient firework 
rockets
 that were used in wars
 long ago
. Departing from the 
use of 
gunpo
wder 
in 
ancient times, m
odern solid fueled 
rockets 
use more 
powerful fuels
[49]
.  Solid propellant motors have simple designs
 and 
are 
easy to handle. 
They are usually consisting of solid 
compounds which are mad of fuel and oxidizer and 

contained in a steel casing. They burn at a very fast speed,
 from the center to
wards
 the
 outer sides of the casing
 and
 expel hot gases to produce thrust. 
The shape of the 
center 

channel determines 
how fast the fuel burns and its patterns, 
which is a good way to control thrust
[50]
.    The factors used in determining the rocket™s performance that is related to the center 
channel are its surface area and specific impulse. The amount
 of propellant exposed to interior 
combustion flames outlines the surface area,
 giving
 a direct relationship with thrust. An increase 
in surface area will increase thrust
, but reduces in burning 
time of fuel
 because 
the propellant is 
being 
used 
at a 
faster
 rate
[50]
. On the other hand, if surface area of the channel is decreased, 
burning time will be increased, thus dec
reasing the thrust. 
The 
most ideal 
thrust is 
represented by
 a constant 
rate of thrust. This
 can be achieved by 
sustaining
 same
 surface area throughout the 
burn. For examples, there are end burning, internal
-core burning, outer
-core burning, and internal 
star core burning 
used 
as designs of constant surface area.
 Various shapes are used to optimize 
the thrust
[50]
.   As p
reviously mentioned, specific impulse also determines rocket performance by 
controlling internal thrust production 
through
 pressure and heat. 
Specific impulse 
is defined by
 the thrust per unit propellant burned 
in 
each second
. During 
the 
ignition
 of an exp
losive fuel 
hot 
and expanding gasses 
are 
created 
to produce thrust
. How large
 of the fuel's explosive power 
is 
and how fast
 combustion 
takes place regulate
 the specific impulse.
 Specific impulse must be 
considered carefully to
 successfully 
optimize
 produci
ng 
thrust
[50]
. There are two different types
 of solid
 propellants
, namely 
homogeneous and 
composite
[51]
. Both are dense, and can be easily stored and operated stably at ordinary 
temperatures.
 Homogeneous pro
pellants 
can consist of 
either simple base or double base. 
For a
 simple base propellant
, a single compound
 is used. N
itrocellulose
 is frequently used
, since it
 has 
both an oxidation and reduction capacity. Double base propellants 
have two compounds
 (usuall
y nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine
) and
 a plasticizer
 is added
 to increase the 
plasticity
 or fluidity of 
a material
. Homogeneous propellants 
are relatively we
ak. Normally
, their
 specific impulses 
are
 less 
than about 210
 seconds
, but they 
have an advantage
 of not produc
ing
 traceable 
smoke
. Thus, homogenous propellants
 are 
often 
used 
as strategic
 weapons
[50]
. They are al
so used 
as 
secondary
 functions 
of rocket launches
 in tasks
, like
 discarding
 spent parts or separating one 
stage from another
[50]
. Composite propellants 
consist of heterogeneous powders or 
mixtures
. Fuel is generally 
made of aluminum and for oxidizers, crystallized or finely ground mineral salt is used. 
More 
specifically, a
mmonium perchlorate is commonly used as an oxid
izer
 and usually occupies
 between 60% and 90% of the mass of the propellant
. The propellant is held together by a 
polymeric binder
 (usually 
polyurethane or polybutadienes
), which is also consumed as fuel. 
Sometimes catalyst is
 included
 to help
 speeding up 
the burning rate
. Other agents
 can be also 
included to make the mixtures
 easier to 
fabricate
[51]. In terms of their classification, c
omposite 
propellants are 
classified
 or defined 
by 
the
 type of polymeric binder used. The two most common 
binders are polybutadiene acrylic acid acrylonitrile (PBAN) and hydroxy
-terminator 
polybutadiene (HTPB). PBAN 
gives
 slightly higher specific impulse, density, and 
burn
ing
 rate 
than equivalent 
amount of
 HTPB. 
On the other hand
, PBAN propellant is 
a lot
 more difficult to 
handle since it is harder
 to mix and process
, also
 requir
ing
 an elevated curing temperature. 
On 
the other hand, 
HTPB 
propellant
 is stronger 
in stronger and more flexible 
to use 
than PBAN. 
Both PBAN and HTPB propellants deliver excellent performance
 with
 good mechanical 
properties, and 
gives
 long 
time of burning
[51]
.  Solid propellant motors 
can be used in many ways
. Small 
solid propellant motors are 
usually used to
 power the final stage of 
a launch 
rocket
, or attach
ed to 
cargos
 to 
be 
lift
ed to 
higher orbits. Medium solid 
propellant motors
 such as the Payload Assist Module (PAM) and the 
Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) 
are used as
 boost
ers
 needed
 to place satellites into geosynchronous 
orbit or on 
planetary trajectories. The Titan, Delta, and Space 
Shuttle launch vehicles 
used
 solid propellant rockets to 
provide 
additional
 thrust 
during the
 lift
-off. The Space Shuttle 
uses the largest solid rocket motors ever built and flown. Each 

booster contains 5
00,000 kg of propellant and can produce up 
to 14,680,000 Newtons of thrust
 force
[51]
.  b) Liqu
id propellant
 Liquid propellant rockets are 
a lot
 more
 powerful 
than 
solid propellant rockets
. With high thrust capacities
, it 
enabled 
first human 
flights
 into space.
 Although l
iquid fueled rockets 
burn
 fuel 
and oxidizer
 like 
conventional solid fuels rock
ets, 
both fuel and oxidizer are
 in liquid state
s[52]
. The oxidizer 
and fuel are mixed and ignited inside the combustion chamber
, creating
 thrust
. In liquid propellant rockets, the fuel and oxidizer must be stored 
separately
 in two
 separate tanks
 made of metal 
since 
many liquid fuels 
catch
 fire and 
burn upon contac
t[52]
. Though liquid propellants
 are more challenging to store in this way than solid fuels, they offer 
distinct advantages, s
uch as high speed exhaust
 gas ejection and 
ability to throttle 
including stop
-and
-restart capability and emergency shutdown. 
Due to t
hese
 features, 
liquid 
propellant 
systems 
are used i
n many upper
-stage applications where high e
scape 
velocity and high propellant mass 
fraction are important
[52]
. Liquid propellants are
 one
 of the most variable
 types of rockets
. With 
a large collection 
of valves
, regulators 
and controllers, t
hey can adjust, 
control and enhance rocket performance. 
During
 launch sequence two valves open
 and
 allow the liquid to flow down the pipe
-work. 
In 
order to prevent
 a weak and unsta
ble thrust rate
, either a pressurized gas feed
 (supply)
 or a turbo
 pump feed
 (supply) 
is used
[52]
. The 
pressu
rized gas feed
 is simpler than the other. It
 adds a tank 
of high pressure gas 
such as helium that is 
unreactive, inert, and light 
to the propulsion system. 
The gas
 is held and regulated
 under 
a very high
 pressure by a valve
 or 
regulator.
 Turbo pump, 
althou
gh more 
complex
, is 
often preferred
 and used more often than the pressurized gas. 
It provides
 solut
ion to the fuel transfer proble
m. A turbo
 pump is the same a
s regular pump in 
function and 
avoids
 a gas
-pressurized system by sucking out the propellants and
 accelerating 
them into the combustion chamber
[51]
.  For oxi
dizer of liquid motors, liquid 
oxygen is used the most. Other oxidizers, such as 
hydrogen peroxide (containing 95% of H2O2), nitric acid (HNO3), and liquid fluorine are also 
used. Among these oxidizers, liquid fluorine produces the highest specific impulse. However, it 

requires high temp
eratures to burn, and it is very difficult to handle this corrosive element that 

might destroy and damage other substances upon contact, liquid fluorine is rarely used. Liquid 

propellants are classified as petroleum, cryogenic, hypergolic. Petroleum fuels 
are developed 

from crude oil and are a mixture of complex hydrocarbon. The petroleum is a type of highly 

refined kerosene, which delivers a specific impulse which is significantly less than cryogenic 
fuels, but larger than hypergolic fuels
[51]
.  Cryogenic propellants use liquid hydrogen as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. 
They are liqu
efied gases, as hydrogen remains liquid at temperature of 
-253 degrees Celsius and 
oxygen remains liquid at 
-183 degrees Celsius. Cryogenic propellants are difficult to store for 
long periods of time since they need to be stored at very low temperatures. T
hus, they cannot be 
used in military rockets since they must be kept for months to be ready for launch at any time. 
Also, liquid hydrogen has a very low density of 0.071 g/ml, which requires a large storage 
volume in turn. Nevertheless, liquid oxygen and l
iquid hydrogen are used as the propellant in the 
main engines of the Space Shuttle due to their high efficiency. They also powered the upper 
stages of the 
Saturn V
 and 
Saturn 1B
 rockets, and the 
Centaur
 which is the first liquid oxygen 
and liquid hydrogen 
rocket in the United States
[51]
. Other examples of cryogenic fuel are liquid 
methane (liqui
d at 
-162 degrees Celsius) and liquid fluorine (liquid at 
-188 degrees Celsius). 
 Hypergolic propellants ignite spontaneously upon contact with each other and require no 
ignition source as they work as both fuels and oxidizers. They can start and restart v
ery easily, 

which is deal for systems of spacecraft maneuvering. They remain liquid at normal temperatures, 

so they can be storage for a longer period time. However, hypergols are highly toxic and must be 

handled exceptionally carefully. Hypergolic fuels i
nclude hydrazine, monomethyl hydrazine, and 
unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine.  A mixture of 50% hydrazine and 50% unsymmetrical 

dimethyl hydrazine fuels is also used and called Aerozine 50. It is as stable as unsymmetrical 

dimethyl hydrazine and gives bett
er performance. Aerozine 50 was used as a propellant with 
nitric acid oxidizer for the Titan and the second stage of the Delta II rocket used propellant. 

Monomethyl hydrazine with nitric acid oxidizer was used in the Space Shuttle orbiter as the 
orbital ma
neuvering system and reaction control system
[51]
. Other propellants were also used as liqui
d fuels. Alcohols were used during the early 
years of rocketry. Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) was used as a fuel source for the German V
-2 missile 
and the USA Redstone, but became obsolete after more efficient fuels were developed. 
Hydrogen peroxide was commonly
 used as a monopropellant and was once used as an oxidizer 
in Britain's Black Arrow rocket. Although its performance and density is high, similar to that of 

nitric acid, and it is far less toxic and corrosive but it is unstable with a poor freezing point. 
With 

catalyst, high
-test peroxide (high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide) decomposes into oxygen 
and superheated steam, producing a specific impulse of about 150 s. Nitrous oxide has been used 
as both an oxidizer and as a monopropellant. It is used for 
many hybrid rocket designs and in 

high
-powered rocketry. With a catalyst, nitrous oxide decomposes exothermically into nitrogen 
and oxygen, producing a specific impulse of about 170 s
[51]
.  To summarize, liquid propellant rockets are currently the most powerful in propulsion 
systems available in terms of gross thrust. However, its high complexity
 (a real modern liquid 
engine has thousands of piping connections and carries various cooling, fueling, or lubricating 

fluids) and other drawbacks made them quite impractical. Because of so many parts they contain, 

there is a large chance that one integral
 function might fail. Also, the most commonly used 
oxidizer, liquid oxygen, requires a temperature of 
-183 degrees Celsius to maintain the liquid 
state. Otherwise, it evaporates and loses a large quantity of oxidizer on the process of loading. 

Another oxid
izer, nitric acid, contains 76% of oxygen and is in the liquid state under the standard 

temperature and pressure, but it is hazardous in handling (producing a strong acid while mixing 

with water) and produces harmful by
-products in combustion with a fuel. 
Thus
, its use is 
limited
[51]
. c) Hybrid 
rockets
 Hybrid
 propellants use both solid and liquid 
propellants
 as fuels to
 combine
 the
 advantages 
each 
propellant
. They
 represent
 an intermediate group between solid and liquid 
propellant. 
Usually
, the 
liquid is used as 
the oxidizer, 
while the
 solid
 is used
 as fuel
. The main 
advantage of is t
hat they have h
igh performance
 and
 can be moderated, stopped, or even 
restarted. 
However,
 given
 the
 difficult
y and complexity in building 
hybrid propellant engines
, they are rarely built. 
An exceptional
 hybrid engine
 was used, however, for 
the vehicle 
SpaceShipOne
, burni
ng nitrous oxide as the liquid oxidizer and HTPB rubber as the solid fuel 
powered
. This engine
 won the Ansari X
-Prize
[51]
.  B. Hypothetical
 1. Ion 
Propulsion for Deep Space
  Despite the decades of history now in launching spacecrafts into space
, modern
 spacecraft
s still are restricted by
 the problem of fuel. 
The conventional ways of propulsion 
are
 ver
y in
efficient in that
 the spacecrafts
 needs 
to carry the same weight of thrust materials as 
its 
own 
weight. 
Because fuel 
ends up being 
the heaviest
 single
 component, the amount of fuel that 
can be carried by rockets is 
limited
. Therefore, spacecrafts are n
ot able to run 
long
 enough to 
lan
d and explore its destinations
[7], [45]
. One of the
 best way
s to solve 
this problem is to find a 
propulsion system that is efficient and lightweight. In 1998
, a spacecraft called 
Deep Space 1
 was sent with 
ion
-thrusters
, where i
onized x
enon gas was used as propellant
. This demonstrated
 that gas is easier to manage
 than solid 
fuel, as
 xenon™
s noble gas 
properties made i
t very stable
, unreactive, and efficient 
[45]
. Moreover
, it was able to 
generate
 10 times 
the
 power 
of the 
conventional rocket
 engines. 
In addition to the ionized gas system, 
Deep Space 1
 contained solar 
panel wings
 that could be 
used 
to 
provide electric power required to manage the systems of 
propulsion
. Its solar panels had a
 combination of 3600 solar cells and more than 700 cylin
drical 
lenses to focus sunlight
; when fully 
charged
, its output 
was
 more than 2000W. 
Alth
ough this 
amount 
is equivalent to the energy needed to 
operate two hair dryers
, it is 
sufficient
 for powering 
the spacecraft™
s ion
-thrusters
[45]
. 2. Field 
propulsion
 systems
 Field propulsion system
, as its name suggests, is a
 propelling system with fields
 with the 
use of any 
fuel
[53]
. It can overcome the speed of the conventional space propulsion systems that 
are very limited and
 requires lots of fuels and cost
. The principle
 behind th
e field propulsion
 is to 
assume that space as a vacuum contains a 
substantial physical structure
 which can be
 interacted 
and used
 as propulsive thrust force.
 The invention of this new propulsion method will enable 
interplanetary
 travel as well as
 interstellar travel
[53]
. Field propulsion 
theory
 is based on Einstein
™s General Relativity Theory in terms of 
its microscopic
 structure; it also has basis in 
Quant
um Field 
Theory
 in a microscopic structure
[53]
. Several kinds of field propulsion can be 
suggested
 by using different physical 
concepts
. In 
General 
Relativity
, the 
gra
vitational field is explained through
 curved space
 and the curvature of 
space is important
. Curvature
 is related to expansion, contraction, elongation, torsion, and 
bending of a
n elastic body.
 Space
-time as a vacuum can be viewed as a transparent, empty
 continuum that is 
universal
 and infinitive, where all these events take place
[53]
. In 
Quantum 
Field Theory
, space
-time is vi
ewed as possessing
 zero
-point fluctuatio
ns (
vacuum
 perturbations)
 which
 is the temporary
 change in the amount of energy with temporal 
appearance of energetic 
particles out of empty space
. The Uncertainty Principle states that a particle pair can suddenly 
emerge from 
the
 vacuum for a very short p
eriod of time. 
Vacuum
 perturbations can
 be controlled 
by 
squeezed
 light 
technology
 which generates states of squeezed vacuum and can control control 
energy density through the coordination geometry. Finally, 
superstring
 theory suggests 
string as 
the fundam
ental element of 
the space
-time continuum, which is presented
 as the 
thread
s of fabric. 
Thus, entropy of space
-time can be 
defined
 as an ensemble of strings, similar to polymer chains 
in an elastic body
[53]
. It may seem that field 
propulsion theory violates the 
conservation law of momentum since, 

the system does not expel any 

momentum.
 However, essentially, space 
is not a state of 
complete
 void or 
nothingness, but i
s a physical reality as 
a continuum which can be reacted 
against under a certain condition
[53]
. 3. Superconductors and Quantum 
Locking
  One of the 
exciting 
developments
 that open
 new 
possibilities for space travel is the 
discovery of quantum levitation and 

quantum locking
[54]
. Using a 
superconduc
tor,
 one can
 demonstrate at 
critical temperatures and magnetic fields can lock the object in space, in mid
-air, giving the 
appearance of levitation. This discovery/technology 
capitaliz
es on the distinctive
 characteristics/properties of superconductors. Superconductors are materials that have virtually 
zero electrical resistance, unlike other conductors in which elec
trons collide with atoms while 

flowing through the material
[54]
. Thus, whereas there is energy loss when using other 
conductors (
usually in the form of heat), superconductors allow electricity to flow 
freely without 
any barriers at 
the quantum level. In addition to zero electrical resistance, superconductors are 
known to have magnetic resistance, where they attempt to expel any magn
etic str
ands that tries 
to enter their 
interior. When placed inside a magnetic field, the superconductor locks any 

interiorly trapped magnetic strands in place, as their movements would dissipate 
energy and 

breaks the state of 
superconductivity. By doing s
o, the superconductor in fact locks itself in place, 
because any movement of the superconductor will again change the configuration. 
This 

phenomenon has been named 
quantum locking, as it is fundamentally a quantum phenomenon 

that the fluxons (i.e. strands 
of magnetic field inside the superconductor) come in discrete 
quan
tities and behave like quantum 
particles
[54]
.  Quantum locking can have a multitude of practical applications that would revolutionize 
how energy is managed in the world. In a single three
-inch disk, approximately a hundred billion 
strands of magn
etic field are inside. With such enormous amounts of currents that can be 
transferred inside superconductors, it would be possible to produce strong magnetic fields for 

MRI machines, particle accelerators, etc; they can also be produced as power cables tha
t transfer 

large amount of electrical current between power stations. Moreover, large amounts of energy 

can be stored with superconductors, because no energy would be dissipated. What is more, the 

force of the levitation achieved by a disk that is only hal
f a micron thick is 70,000 times its own 
weight. This remarkably strong force can be used for many applications. For example, a two
-millimeter
-thin superconducting layer could hold a small car of 1,000 kilograms
[54]
.   Quantum locking opens new possibilities for space travel as well. As long as the 
superconducto
r is kept below its critical cold temperature through insulation and other modes of 
temperature control, it will stay locked in mid
-air on top of a regular magnet. On top of a circular 
magnet where the magnetic field is equal all around, the superconductor
 is able to freely rotate 
around the axis of the magnet without friction. Even when the magnet is turned upside down, the 
superconductor will remain locked in the same position in regard to the magnet. The direction of 

this frictionless travel can be contr
olled by simply adjusting the magnetic field, in the form of 
magnets/magnetic field of different shapes. For example, Almog demonstrated that on top of a 

large circular magnetic rail, the superconducting disk moves freely along the rail as a monorail 

train
 would, but without the friction. The position and configuration of the traveling 
superconducting disk can easily be changed by rotation, and it will continue to move freely in its 
new position
[54]
.  4. Using Earth
™s Magnetism as Energy Resource
  Throughout history no one has used 
the Earth
™s magnetism as the sour
ce for propulsion
. Although the Earth
™s magnetism is quite weak, it is what keeps us from being harmed by cosmic 
rays, solar winds, causing auroras from cosmic collisions. 
And what if the E
arth
™s magn
etic field 
could be augmented? Like the sun, magnetism f
rom the E
arth
™s and other planets
™ magnetic
 fields are 
forces that are ever present throughout the universe; however, they have been 
entirely 
uninvestigated. 
If technology can be developed to take 
advantage
 of this energy, it will mean 
that 
no energy will 
need to be spent on mining, collecting, and refining this energy to a usable form. 
It also will save us from the trouble when we happen to run out of fuel during 
intergalactic
/space 
travel. Imagine having to refuel on liquid hydrogen or whatever 
fuel out o
n Mars, and how costly 

that would be. 
 As t
he goal of space travel is to 
be self
-sustaining
, and 
travel farther and father,
 it would be wise to
 build a sophisticated spaceship that can utilize multiple energy sources
. Like a 
hybrid car, 
it would
 be able to
 switch between them under appropriate conditions.
 Though the 
Earth magnetism may be too weak to provide thrust for escape velocity, perhaps new discoveries 

on supercondutors 
[54]
 can magnify the given magnetism and levitate spacecrafts into space. 
Once in space, 
not a 
lot of energy 
will be needed 
to keep 
going
; the small amount
s of magnetism 
should be sufficient 
to keep going. 
 5. Plasma
  Another new technology that has reached the test stage of development is the magneto
-plasma propulsion, named 
VASIMR 
(Variable Specific Impulse Magneto Plasma Rocket). In 
VASIMAR,
 natural gas is converted into plasma, or very hot partially ionized gas, by high power 
radio
-waves 
within
 a chamber
[17]
. These fast moving plasma particles are guided by strong 
magnetic fields from the engine
™s magnet to have them shoot out and cre
ate thrust. The magnetic 
fields
 will also keep other rocket materials from melting in extreme heat. The hotter the plasma 
gets, the faster will the
 gas particles move and  provide that much more thrust for the
 VASIMR
 to travel, reaching speeds that are a h
undred times more than chemical rockets. This is the model 
that is being developed
 by the Ad Astra Rocket 
Company
, and it is thought that this technology 
could take astronauts to Mars in approximately 39 days. The first launch is being planned to take 

plac
e at ISS, after VASMIR is taken into orbit by a traditional chemical rocket. Then, aboard at 

the ISS, 
VASMIR
 will be switched into plasma drive, just as a car would go into third and fo
urth 
gear after the first two
[17]
. 6. Solar sail
   For 
interplanet
ary
 travel that requires even farther distances, the solar sail has been 
proposed as a promising 
technology
 to achieve it. Solar sail stands as one of the most 
realistic 
options for interplanetary and even 
intergalactic
 travel, as it 
eliminat
es 
both rocket
 fuel and 
rocket engines
 that have been limiting space travel until now
[55]
. In the 
solar sail
-powered 
spacecraft
, both
 the rocket fuel and engine are replaced 
with sails
 that are powered by the 
sun's 
constant pressure of photons. The sails are made 
of reflective 
material that has the sunlight
™s photons bounce
 off of it; as 
these light particles bounce off the mirror
-like sail, they 
transfer
 their 
momentum to the sail
 to nudge it 
along
[56]
. As for the force of this nudge, it is true that
 the force 
on a solar
-sail spacecraft is 
far 
less than a 
conventional chemical rocke
t like 
the space shuttle
. In 
the distance that the Earth has from the sun (150 million km, or 1 AU), NASA researchers found 
that sunlight can produce about 1.4 kw of power
[56], [57]
. Divid
ing that number by the speed of 
light, 300 million m/sec, we find that force exerted by the sun is about 4.67×
[10]^(-6) N. 
  Although this small amount of force 
does not initially appear like much, especially in 
relation to the force produced by the space 
shuttle™s engine (1.67 million N during liftoff, 2.1 
million N in vacuum), 
it is important to remember that 
many photons 
are being constantly 

emitted 
from 
the sun
[55]
. Therefore, this 
continuous force 
from
 sunlight 
will give 
constant 
acceleration
 to the space craft.
 In the space
™s almost completely frictionless vacuum, such 
gentle 
constant acceleration 
can eventually thrust a spacecraft to 
velocities that are 5 to 10
 times faster
 (~90 km/sec
) than traditional rockets
 (8km/sec)
[58]
. With this eventual top speed, the 
solar sail 
vehicle 
would be able to reach 
Los Angeles
 from
 New York in less than a minute.
 In another 
illustration, it would only t
ake only eight years 
for a presently 
launched 
solar sail vehicle to catch 
up with 
the most distant Voyager 1 spacecraft 
that 
has been traveling for more than 20 years
[57], 
[58]
. In addition, the solar sail
 spacecraft 
will most likely have 
laser 
or 
magnetic beam 
propulsion 
mechanism
 also onboard, for when it travels even more distant 
from sunlight.
 By 
adding 
such a 
transmitter, NASA 
believes
 that the 
speed
 could go up
 to 30,000 km/sec
, one-tenth 
the speed of light
[56]
.  On Dec. 6, 2010,
 NASA finally ejected its 
NanoSail
-D nanosatellite 
into low earth orbit 
for it to 
demonstrat
e the
 solar sail system
[55]
. The successful deployment has been long time in 
coming since Kepler
™s origina
l inception of the idea. 
NASA
 had 
designed and operated 
a solar 
sail program in the 1970s
, but the technology to produce the ultrathin, heat
-resistant, highly 
reflective 
material
 was not yet complete
[55], [58]
. With sails that were 
too heavy
, the design and 
launch of a solar sailing vehicle
 was im
practical. 
However, the
 sails 
available 
today are 
almost
 100 times thinner than an average sheet of 
pap
er, and NAS
A™s version of the giant sails are 
called
 CP-1. Planetary Society
, a 
private, non
-profit group
 in Pasadena, CA,
 uses the 
aluminum
-reinforced stretched polyester film
 Mylar
 (also known as 
BoPET or biaxially
-oriented 
polyethylene terephthalate
) for its spacecraft 
Cosmos 1
[59]
. These sails
 are 
about
 one-fourth the 
thickness of a plastic trash bag.
 Alternatively, the 
Marshall Space Flight Cente
r supports
 a rigid, 
lightweight carbon fiber materia
l that is 
200 times thicker 
than today
™s standard solar sail
,  but 
weighs
 about the same as the thinnest materials being tested 
due to its 
thousands of tiny 
holes
[17], [56]
.  Another ch
allenge for the earlier success of the
 solar sail
 spacecraft has been its inability 
to be 
launched directly from the ground. A
lthough NASA
™S Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
 did 
demonstrate in an experiment that that the solar sails could be powered to lift
off using 
microwave 
and
 laser beams
, a second spacecraft is
 still
 needed 
for the 
launch 
of 
the solar sail
[58]. Once launched, the sails are 
ejected from the carrier spacecraft
 using an inflatable boom system
, triggered by a built
-in deployment mechanism.
 This launch mechanism has experienced several 
failures, however. In 2005, the 
100 kg-Cosmos 
1 was
 launched 
from
 the Volna rocket from 
a Russian sub
marine
 in the Barents Sea. 
Rather than its planned 
orbit 
at the height of 
885km above 
Earth
, the rocket only reached 72.4km into space before falling back into the ocean and never 
being found again
[17]
. In 2008
, NanoSail
-D was launched on Space X
™s third attempt for Falcon 
1. However, this launch also ended in failure after two minutes of take
-off, with the solar sail lost 
in the ocean. First success was seen in 
June
, 2010, when
 Japan™
s Ikaros probe 
ejected
 its 
solar 
sail
 spacecraft to sail
 through space propelled only by sunlight.
  In 2011, NASA
™s another 
attempt at launching the NanoSail
-D succeeded, but not without some drama
[55]
. Three
 days 
after its ejection from satellite mothership
 FASTSAT
, NanoSail
-D satellite was supposed to 
deploy and start unfolding its
 100-square
-foot s
ail
 with four booms; however,
 no evidence 
could
 identify it in low
-Earth orbit
. After more than a month later, 
NanoSail
-D popped free on its own
 and started 
flying free above Earth
. Currently NanoSail
-D, which is about the 
size of a loaf of 
bread
, is being
 tracked
 by 
amateur radio operators 
called 
ﬁhamsﬂ
 by 
listen
ing 
for the little 
satellite's signal
 at 437.270 MHz.
 It is expected that 
NanoSail
-D will stay in low
-Earth orbit 
for
 70 - 120 days, depending on atmospheric conditions

. 7. Space Elevator
  Figure 
2. Simulated
 prototype of space elevator (
from 
Dvorsky, 2013)
   The sp
ace elevator is an alternative way to reach space that has been proposed by a 
handful of futurists, imaging a mechanism that could make a scenario like Jack and the Beanstalk 
possible
[7], [17]
. Proponents of this proposal 
hold that the space elevator would be
 an 
inexpensive and reliable method of access
ing space
 as the permanent installment of the
 elevator 
could pay itself off.
 These proponents have suggested that the elevator could lower 
the cost of 
space travel from $20,000/kg (cost of using conventional rocket propulsion to thrust a satellite 
into space) to 
as low as 
$200/kg
[7]
.   Although at first glance, the image of a long cable ascending from Earth into space seems 
like something that would appear in a science fiction 
story or fairytale, the principles behind the 
idea are real and feasible. 
The system will begin at an a
nchor 
station
, where a strong ribbon of 
carbon nanotube cables will be held 
from a mobile platform in the equatorial Pacific.
 (Such 
location for the anch
or station will be crucial in avoiding disturbances by extreme climate 
conditions, as well as keeping clear of air traffic.) 
The cable will extend
 well above the Earth
™s geostationary orbit 
Œ 100,000km from the Earth, according to one design 
Œ ending at a 
platform 
counterweight. A lifter, most likely powered by electrical motors (
receiving electricity from
 photovoltaic
 cells
, galvanized by free
-electron lasers)
, will ascend and descend along the cable, 
carrying different payloads as well as humans
[7], [17]
.   The most important forces in play 
here 
are 
the 
Earth
™s gravity and the 
counterweight 
platf
orm
™s centrifugal 
that would be acting in 
opposite directions. 
This concept is well
-illustrated
 by imagining a person rotating, in order 
to swing around a long piece of string with a weight 

attached at the end of it. This rotating motion of the weight will
 cause the centrifugal force 
to be 

directed 
radially
 outward from the center, 
which
 will keep the string taut. 
Along
 this taut string, 
an 
ant 
could climb 
steadily
 to 
eventually reach
 the weight
 attached at
 the end. 
Although this 
analogy falters 
here 
becaus
e the person, 
unlike the Earth (
the rotating center
), does not have 
innate gravity that would pull t
he ant back toward himself, this picture is useful in understanding 
how the
 centrifugal force 
works
. In the same way, the centrifugal force 
on the space ele
vator
™s counterweight platform will 
keep the elevator system upright and intact. The mass of the 

platform will also ensure that the center of mass of the system stay
s sufficiently above the 
earth
[7], [60]
.  In r
evisiting the counterweight, its necessity 
is indubitable,
 given that it will work against 
the Earth
™s gravitational force to keep the cable taut. 
The cable
 would
 provide
 the 
lifter 
with 
something 
to climb along the cable. 
In the design of the space elevator, this lifter would be the 
robotic platform
 with t
raction
-tread rollers
 that 
would clamp on to the ribbon and pull the ribbon 
through
.  The lifter will be p
owered by a free
-electron laser system located on or near the anchor 
station. The laser will beam 2.4 megawatts of energy to photovoltaic cells, perhaps made of 
Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) attached to the lifter, which will then convert that energy to electric
ity 
to be used by conventional, niobium
-magnet DC electric motors, according to the ISR
[7], [17], 
[60]
.  However, in order for this to happen, there is a big limiting factor in the cable itself. 
Although 
all of the other pieces of the space elevator can be constructed using known technology, 
including the robotic lifter, anchor s
tation and power
-beaming system
, the cable needs to be 
strong enough to withstand the expected forces. 
 It is estimated that the cable will need to have a 
tensile strength that is 
above a 100 GPa, and recently carbon nanotubes have been touted as the 

answe
r to realizing the space elevator dream, with its theoretically possible strength of 100 

GPa
[7], [17]
. Carbon nanotubes
 are 
microscopic
 structures that have 
cylindrical wall
s. They
 are 
only 30% denser than water, 
but 32 times stronger than steel, 
and 
have a theoretical breaking 
length of more than 10,000 km
. Some optimistic scientists state that
 in theory
, the tensile 
strength of a well
-produced carbon nanotube 
could 
reach 
up to 300 GPa.
 However, not everyone 
is optimistic about its 
attainability
, as 
the current state of our technology on
ly 
affords
 the means 
to produce carbon nanotube
s with the t
ensile strength of 63 GPa and the length of 1 meter
[61]
.   Nevertheless,
 when and if the necessary 100 GPa is reached by the advancement of 
technology, t
he process of 
constructing the space elevator has been estimated to take up to 2 
years from that time
[7]
. The process will involve first launching a rocket to geosynchronous 
orbit at about 35,900km from the E
arth™
s surface. Thus remaining in hovering position, the 
satellite would then lower a cable back t
o the Earth, and be fixed to its a
nchor station. From then 
on, climbers would be sent up to the satellite to create a stronger 
ribbon
 by adding strands of new 
carbon nanotube cable to the existing one. The satellite would also climb higher at this point, 

reaching up to 100,000km above the Earth surface, and become the counterweight platform at 
the
 end to hold up the system upright. 
 Once operational, 
the 
lifters could be climbing the space 
elevator nearly every day. The lifters will vary i
n size from 
5 to 2
0 tons. The 20
-ton lifter will be 
able to carry as much as 13 tons of payload and have 900 cubic meters of space. Lifters would 

carry cargo ranging from satellites to solar
-powered panels and eventually humans up the ribbon 
at a speed of about 118 miles pe
r hour (190 km/hour).
 For any of such cargo, it is also estimated 
that if released from the elevator at
 100,000km, they could have enough tangential 
velocity
 to 
reach even Saturn, as they will be whirling around the Earth at more than 11km/sec
 by that poin
t. Thus, the elevator would provide an alternative method of propulsion for space travel
[7], [60]
.  However, many
 critiques 
exist for 
the fea
sibility of the space elevator, 
enough to 
render
 the idea
 impractical and dangerous. 
These critiques have to do with the dangerous 
vibrations 

caused by the natural
 resonant frequency
 of the cable; the wobble
 and whipping action
 caused by 
gravitational pulls of the sun and the moons well as solar wind; possible impact with 
asteroids
 and space junk
; possible terrorist attacks 
and 
impracticality of constant preventative surveillance 
system
[61]
. First, it has been warned that the 
gravitational 
pull 
from the 
moon and 
sun, along 
with pressure from solar wi
nd may
 shake the cable
 dangerously
. In violent motions, the cable 
could potentially whip into orbiting 
satellite
s and
 space 
junk, and become unstable due to its lack 
of 
resistance against 
folding 
or bending
[61]
. This possible movement 
is no light matter. 
Even the 
smallest movement could
 cause a wobble
 or a swing in the cable, 
that the 
velocity of any 
spacecraft or object exiting the elevator 
would be
 either
 boost
ed or reduce
d. 
This could put 
the 
objects
 seriously
 off
 from the intended course, 
by as much as ten or more kilometers
[61]
. Even if 
thrusters 
are 
attached
 to the cable to counteract any movement, the simple logistics of 
attaching
, maint
ainin
g, and 
refueling
 them, as well as bypass
ing them during the elevator climb will pose 
serious 
complications.
 Secondly, 
the problem of 
vibrational harmonics 
caused by the cable
™s natural resonant frequency
, as well as vibrational energy caused by the lifter
 and climbers may 
overwhelm the system
™s tolerance. The addition of a 
dampening system
 to the cable, however, 
poses similar complications as adding thrusters for addressing the issue of violent shaking
[61]
.   Thirdly, it is important to remember that there are other objects in orbit that could collide 
with the cable. 
As mention
ed in a previous section, a
mong the most problematic objects in orbit 
are space junk, comprised of pieces such as n
on-functional space
 craft
s, a
bandoned launch 
vehicle stages
, mission
-related debris
, and f
ragmentation debris
[35], [39]
. Given the E
arth™s 
rotational speed 465.1m/sec, the velocity of the debris in orbit at 2,000km above the Earth can be 
estimated to be about 609.3m/sec
[61]
. The damage done by collision with even the smallest 
debris could be devastating, as it has 
already
 destroyed many spacecraft components 
at even
 lower orbit
s[37]
Œ[39]
. However, t
he challenge in
 finding all of the debris in 
orbit 
and 
clean
ing 
them 
up remains
 a formidable one. 
At the present time, NASA is operating an 
Orbital Debris 
Program
 since
 1995, conducting 
research
 in m
odeling
, me
asurements
, protection
, mitigation
, and 
reentry
 aspects
[40]
. However, the best known and practiced method to address the space debris 
issue 
still remains debris tracking and avoidance maneuvers
[37]
 Œ and 
adding built
-in detection 
and maneuver systems for debris avoidance would be as tri
cky as it would be for resolving the 
issue of movement with thrusters, as mentioned previously. 
Other concerns
 raised by critics and 
scientists are multiple, and they
 include
 corrosion
 and
 ionization
 due to r
adiation
[61]
.    IV.
 Other Considerations
 A. Contribution to Society
 The 
secondary
 use of space technology in everyday 
life
 has 
enhanced
 the
 quality of 
life 
for people around the world. It would not be an overstatement to say that 
the 
applications of 
space technology have 
improved 
the medical system in the U.S. as well as its 
economy
. In fact, it 
is estimated that more
 than 30,000 
re-applied 
technologies
 from space exploration are 
now 
used 
in homes, schools, offices, markets, outdoors, fields, hospitals, etc
 [62]
. For example, e
xercise 
mach
ines in gyms and sports centers
 were 
originally
 designed
 for the 
astronauts
 in space to 
prevent long
-term weakening of 
their muscles and bones
. Ergometer
s were 
built for
 astronauts
 to 
measure their 
muscles work output
; they now 
aid in stimulating 
the 
muscle
s of 
the 
paralyzed
.[62] In the medical field
, artificial
 pacemakers
 designed 
to control the patients
™ heart
beat from
 irregularities caused by
 cardiac
 conditions are applications of the machinery that controlled 
the 
engine pump of a rocket.
  Many other portable medical device
s in ambulances 
were 
also 
originally made to 
meet
 the ne
eds 
of 
transportability
 of equipment in space
[63]
. Moreover, 
remote monitoring devices for intensive care patients were derived from the telemetry systems 
that first monito
red astronauts and spacecraft.
 The te
chnologies that led to the computer bar 
codes in retail stores, quartz timing crystals and household smoke detectors were originally 
developed for NASA
[63]
. B. Contribution to Science
 and Technology
 In addition to the benefits that technological innovations in rocket s
cience brought to the 
world, research done in outer space has also contributed much to society. A big area of 
research
 done in space has to do with microgravity. T
he microgravity environment 
afforded
 by satellites, 
ISS
, and other spacecrafts has
 enabled 
lab experiments
 that could 
never
 be done on earth
. Although the state of vacuum has always been thought as a threat from
 the ancient time
s, it is no 
longer a threat,  as many
 innovati
ons have resulted from past and present microgravity 
research
[64]
. To name a few
, these innovations include
 ﬁlight bulbs, integrated circuits, freeze
-dried foods, particle acce
lerators, elec
tron microscopes
, weather forecasting
, human fligh
t (p.
1)ﬂ[64]
. These varied innovations were able to come out of 
microgravity research, because the 
experiments done in ISS are not limited to rocket science or astrophysics. Rather, they include 
experiments in 
ﬁfundamental physics, biology, fire
fighting, medicine, climate
, etc.
 (p.1)
ﬂ [64]
  In space, even the most familiar things that we take for granted on earth behave 
differently. For instance, 
flames on e
arth
 have a shape
 of a teardrop, due to
 the rising
 hot air 
within a
 gravitational field. 
In space, 
flames
 instead
 break apart into li
ttle balls that move around 
freel
y, 
burn
ing while 
using almost no 
fuel
. Therefore, research projects such as 
SOFBALL
-2, have attempted to
 light up
 some flame balls
, measure their properties
, and hopefully replicate the 
fuel 
saving effect on energy saving cars on earth
[64]
. In the state of weightlessness, h
uman 
brains
 and bodies also behave differently in their efforts to adjust to the foreign environment. 
 It 
has been found that t
he brain adapts to weightlessness
, and therefore directionlessness,
 by 
building 
a mental 
model
 that could guide the 
body 
in making sense of the 
unusual experiences. 
Soon after such adjustment, 
sleeping 
ﬁupside downﬂ
 becomes normal; studying this 
process
 of 
adaptation is thought to reveal new insights into the capacities of the human brain 
[64]
. Lastly, 
even the difference in smell of flowers have been noted and applied into an actual fragrance by 
the 
Japanese 
cosmetics 
company Shiseido
, naming this unique floral scent 
ﬁZen
ﬂ[64]
. Although 
it is hard to expect what other aspects of normal life and beh
avior would be different in space, 
these fascinating discoveries will challenge many assumptions and boundaries of science.  
 Gaining Energy from Outer Space
 Although solar power has huge potential to be used for energy source and many scientists 
have drea
med of collecting the solar energy 
and use it in 
everyday
 life
, its limitations has 
prevented it from being used. While people need electricity whole day around the year, there is 
no sunlight at nights to collect solar energy 
and no region close to centers
 of population has 
cloud
-free 365 days a year. The best locations to gather solar energy are the deserts of Southwest 
America, far from civilizations. Thus, it is necessary to find some ways to store the energy to use 

in times and places where no sunlight 
is provided, yet not one found the way to do this in a large 

scale. Back in 1960s and 1970s, some innovative thinkers have though ways to provide solar 

power from 
space and sending it back to earth
, but this concept seemed impractical and 

somewhat like a s
cience fiction at that time. However, recently, the idea of providing solar power 
from a base in space to the earth gained some 
possibilities
 and more supports. A 
group
 of 
engineers in 2008 led a successful 
experiment
 by using technology that can be deploy
ed in 
space
-based solar power. They succeed in taking energy from solar cells and beaming it to the 
Big Island of Hawaii, 92 miles from Maui after converting it to microwaves and gained 20 watts 

worth of electricity
[57]
. In reality, 
California's biggest energy utility
, Pacific Gas
 & Electric 
(PG&E) signed an agreement with a startup company, Solaren Corporation, 
to purchase 200 

megawatts of electricity
 gathered from the so
lar power beam
ed to Earth 
from 
outer
 space
, beginning in 2016
 for 15 years
. Solaren
 Corporation 
is planning to 
produce the power
 through
 solar panels in Earth orbit and convert it to radio
-frequency transmissions that 
will
 be 
beamed 
down to a receiving station in Fresno. 
The energy
 will then
 be c
onverted into electricity and 
stored
 into
 a power grind of 
PG&E
[65]
. This project is 
based on commun
ications satellite 
technology
 and will
 bec
ome th
e first real
-world a
pplication of space solar power
 if 
succeeded
. Nevertheless, there are still many obstacles. A
 series of large satellites
 are needed to
 launch
 into 
space, 
as well as 
robotic technology
 to assemble the solar arrays
 and 
microwave tec
hnology
 to transmit
 the energy
 22,000 miles to earth
 from space
, then 
finally, 
converting that energy to 
electricity on the ground
. Due to the advancements in
 technolog
y, these became feasible 
nowadays, despite the fact that many have doubted only a decade
 ago
[65]
.  John Mankins, the manager for advanced concepts for NASA
, talk
ed about one of the 
ideas from NASA about what to do with the space shuttles was to 
launch
 space habitats, which is 
to get as many people to live and work in space. These people in space can work on building 
satellites that are solar
-powered. Mankin
s™ team
 also 
assembled
 to find out in mid 1990s 
whether 
advances in technology 
would make
 space
-based solar power more feasible. 
And it was so as we 
can see with our advanced robotic technology, 
far more efficient solar cells cheaper
, more 
precise digital devices
 that can beam 
energy accurately
 back
 to earth
, more
 reliable launch 
technology, 
and 
lighter and stronger materials 
available, it is possible to build a better
 solar 
station
 as well as
 solar arrays
 in outer space.
 One way 
PG&E
 is planning to increase
 effic
iency
 of solar cells
 is to use parabolic reflectors 
that will
 concentrate sunlight onto the cells.
 However, 
as 
Cal Boerman, 
the 
director of energy services 
at 
Solaren
, said, t
he biggest expense
 will be
 the 
cost of getting into space
[57]
. This can be solved using the alternative 
propulsion
 methods 
mentioned in previous chapter. Thus, by 
developing
 the space program, along with modes of 
transportation into space, will help gain environmental energy and produce many other 
possibilities
 in saving energy
[57]
.  V. Expe
rimental Study on 
Generalizing Space Travel 
 A. Methods 
 In order to 
increase the perception of 
feasibility
 of space travel 
for 
the 
general 
public, 
two 
educational talks were delivered 
to 
2 different groups
 of audience 
over 
the
 course of 
two
 days. 
These talks comprised of the
 same content
, and included th
e administration of a pre and post 
survey
. One group
 of participants
 was chosen
 randomly at 
a Language 
School, in Brighton, MA. 
The group was consisted of mostly ESL (English as Second Language) students, several ESL 
teachers and program coordinator. Their
 background varied widely as well as their age. The 
other group was the members of 
a Christian 
community
 in Newton, MA. The participants were 
of 
a homogeneous
 racial 
group
 from South Korea, except
 for four
 younger 
participants
 who were 
considered Korean
-American. Although their ages varied from 
elementary
 school 
children
 to 
adults,
 participants
 all readily understood the content of the presentation and indicated that they 
subscribed to the same culture
. The t
wo 
paper
-and
-pencil 
surveys were administered on 
site
 to 
the participants, providing both
 written answers 
and responses to 
multiple choice questions. 
Several comments were also provided to improve the talk for the future reference.
 B. Measures
 Participants
 with different backgrounds
 completed the pre and
 post surveys
 to 
indicate
 their 
view on space travel
, as well as any changes to their views after listening to the informative 
talk.
 During the pre
-surveys, participants were asked
 to rate their interest in space travel for 6 
items on a scale of 1 to 5, wi
th 1 being 
ﬁNot at all, 
ﬁ and 5 being 
ﬁVery much.
ﬂ In addition, 
14 true
-and
-false questions 
were asked 
to assess their background knowledge of space travel as well 
as their attitudes toward it. 
During the post
-survey, participants provided 
demographic 
info
rmation (i.e. 
race and nationality, 
culture,
 primary language, gender,
 age, 
level of education, 
field of study or occupation, yearly 
income
, and 
number of 
household
) as well as the answers to 
the same 14 true
-and
-false questions for comparison 
(see Appendi
x C and D
). On the post
-survey, participants also indicated general comments and suggestions for improvement for the 
speaker. 
These questions included how much percentage of the talk was comprehensible based 

on participant
™s English level, how 
the talk did
 help them to consider traveling space, whether 
the talk increased their excitement, found the space 
travel
 as a real 
possibility
 in the future, saw 
the benefits of exploring space to the society. 
Participants could
 choose not to answer if they are 
not sur
e about the answer
, or did not feel comfortable answering t
hem.   VI.
 Results and Discussion
   Demographics
. At 
Language School (
LS), 27 participants 
attended the informative talk
. Among those participants, the pre
-survey was 
completed
 by 25 
participants
, and 
post
-survey by 
22 participants. At 
Christian Community (C
C), 16 
attended the talk, but 
12 completed both pre 
and post 
surveys. Data from the survey showed that the p
articipants 
were from
 5 different racial 
groups: White/Caucasian (18.9%), Latino/Latina (21
.6%), East Asian (48.6%), Southeast Asian 
(2.7%), 
and Middle Eastern Asian (8.1%)
. Their origins were
 from 14 different nation
s, including 
Korea, China, Japan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Brazil, Ukraine, USA, Tunisia, 

Colombia, Portugal, Poland,
 and
 Croatia
. The average age of the 
participants was 26.9 years old, 
with a range of 
10 to 49. The participants
™ primary languages were English, Spanish, 
Portuguese
, Polish, Russian, Croatian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and Thai. 
  Interest in Space Tra
vel. On average, participants indicated that they had average or 
above average interest
 in outer
 space
/universe
, sci
-fi movies/fantasies, going
 adventures, taking 
risks, 
trying new things, and leaving familiar places
 to go out
. The

    Background Knowledge of Space Travel.
 The number of correct answers that participants 
provided for
 the 
pre
-survey questions 
was
 on average 8.68 out of 14 questions asked. 
The 
number 
increased 
to 
10.2 questions out of 14 questions
 asked in the post
-survey
. Although a 
statistical test of mean dif
ference
s could not be performed due to the 
small population, 
descriptive results 
suggest 
that 
the participants
™ knowledge about space exploration 
did change in 
the expected direction through the talk
. For each true
-and
-false knowledge question of the post
-survey, more than 50% 
of the
 participants gave the 
right 
answers; this also was an improvement 
from 
 the pre
-survey, where only 
8 questions out of 14 
gained correct answers  from more 
than 
50% of the group. 
Also, majority of people (more than 
50%) answered
 positively
, indicating
 that 
the talk did help them to
 give consideration 
about space travel (64.7%), to increase their 
excitement about space travel (73.5%),
 to feel space travel as a real possibility for the future 
(55.9%), and 
to 
see the space explorati
on beneficial
 for the society (58.8%). 
Few 
participants 
gave negative answers to the 
abovementioned evaluative questions
: 4 out of 34 participants 
responded 
ﬁnoﬂ for the first 3 questions (11.7%), and 3 out of 34 participants gave
 a negative 
response
 to th
e last question (8.82%). 
Some participants chose to answer with 
ﬁI am not sure,
ﬂ even when given yes or no answer choices; 
23.55%, 14.7%, 3
2.4%, 32.4% of the participants, 
respectively, 
answered
 that they were not sure

   Comparing 
between the
 two groups, the first group from 
LS answered more correct 
answers (
m = 
8.96 correct 
out of 
14) than the other group from C
C (m = 
8.15 out of 14) for the 
pre
-survey questions.
 However
, for the post
-survey, 
CC group showed
 greater
 gain scores than 
the LS group. 
CC group participants obtained 
11.46 
correct answers on 
average 
out of 14 
questions, whereas
 the LS group obtained 
9.43 out of
 14, on average.
 Such differential gain 
scores may be explained by 
cultural 
factors, environmental factors (C
C had a
 better 
audio/visual 
system to support the delivery of talk
), or the number of participants
 in each group
 (n= 26 vs.
 n=16). It is possible that in the smaller CC group, 
the interaction between the speaker and 
audience was more intimate and engaging
. Moreov
er, the 
Korean culture of learning 
may 
have 
helped 
the CC group 
to focus during the presentation and learn more. 
Indeed, younger children 
CC participants 
asked more fundamental questions 
during the talk, 
such as 
how and why;
 older 
participants 
tended to as
k more techni
cal questions. The participation
 of young elementary 
school 
children
 in the second group 
may
 have helped the rest of members of the group to hear 
more fundamental answers from 
the basic
 questions asked
, which might have affected the result.
 More detailed results of the survey are shown in Appendix E and F.
   Given the limited, exploratory nature of the study,
 it was 
challenging
 to find any 
statistically 
significant
 correlation
s between 
the participant
™s background, interests, and 
knowledge 
on space
 travel.
 In future 
renditions of the study, it would be 
more effective 
to speak 
louder, as the survey
 comments 
suggested. Furthermore
, more sophisticated techniques in 
engaging the adult audience may be helpful
.  On the whole, however

  some evidence that an informative
 presentation 
on the history, problems, and solutions of space 
travel

    VII.
 Conclusion
  Space travel has had a relatively short history, beginning from the 1960s. Despite its 
recency, the field has seen rapid development over the last several decades. Once the domain of 
governm
ents, space travel is now also in the private sector. In 2001, the first commercial human 
space flight took place: Dennis Tito travelled to the International Space Station in exchange for 

providing funds to NASA. Since then, several other wealthy 
businessm
en purchased their rides 
into space. 
Currently, it is estimated that more than
 625 lay people have signed up for sub
-orbital 
space flights with Virgin Galactic, one of 6 privately
-owned companies that could launch 
humans into space
[1]
. Exciting developments in space tourism does not end there. The 
destinations in space
 accessible to the public are also expanding to the moon, Mars, and asteroid 
belts and moons of Jupiter. However, there still are significant barriers in 
making
 space travel a 
reality for the general public, namely the concerns over cost, safety, and conve
nience. This paper 
examine
d and analyze
d these 
problems in
 depth and posits the problem of propulsion as the 
central issue to target. Building upon these analyses, several alternatives 
were discussed. 

 Additionally, a
 brief exploratory intervention study w
as conducted to investigate whether 
an informative presentation on the current developments of 
human space travel would increase 

the public™
s perceived 
accessibility
 of space travel. 
Results indicated that when 
issues
 of cost, 
safety, and convenience are t
argeted
 and
 resolved
 through offering alternative solutions in recent 
developments
, participants indeed considered 
space travel to be
 more of
 a personally feasible 
aspiration. 
Through the brief study, it also became evident that the 
topic of s
pace travel i
s inherently very interesting to everyone, as all participants indicated at least an average degree of 

interest in space travel. As the exciting decades of the space race had also demonstrated, the new 

frontiers of space indeed 
sparks 
the human imagination
, inspires us, 
and
 gives us a 
larger 
goal to 
aspire to. 
It is through this
 aspiration 
that 
we came to 
develop
 many 
technological 
innovations 
that we 
now have come to enjoy
 in every
day life; it is through this aspiration that we will surpass 
even higher bou
ndaries and become a space
-faring civilization. 
 However, in order to make this 
aspiration into reality, bringing such topics closer to the general public may be an 
important
 aspect of the process. Once made aware of the benefits and excitement of space tr
avel, all will 
see that it is a 
worth to 
topic of 
study
, development, 
and investment for the future of our race.

 ""Future of Space Travel
""      Abstract:
 The purpose of this presentation is to bring space travel closer to
 ordinary
 people
 as something 
that is relevant and feasible. The talk will cover brief history of space travel, the reasons for lack 
of progress in the last few decades, and some recent exciting developments in the field. More 

specifically, the topics include hazard
s of space travel, principles of current rockets, privatization 
of space travel enterprise, 
and 
possible alternative sources for rocket propulsion
 such as using 

earth™s magnetic field,
 superconductors and quantum locking. This 30 minute presentation will 
include multimedia and lively discussions. A survey will be administered afterwards.

new picture books
26 October 2015, byMarcia Dunn
  
 
  
This October 2015 photo provided by the Curren family
shows Roraigh Curren in his home in Lancashire,
England. The 7-year-old won a contest by London-based
Lost My Name books with the prize of a personalized
version of ""The Incredible Intergalactic Journey Home""
sent to the space station in December 2015 for a
reading. (Ciaran Curran via AP)
Once upon a time, when NASA's shuttles were still
flying, an astronaut read a children's story from
space. 
Thus was born Story Time from Space, a program
that takes bedtime stories to new heights in its
effort to get children excited about science.
The latest bundle of 
picture books
, mostly about 
space
, is scheduled to rocket to the International
Space Station in just over a month, joining five
bedtime stories already there. The astronaut
readings are posted online, available at any time for
children to see.
The delivery, targeted for December, was delayed
a year because of a Virginia launch explosion.
Another launch accident, this one from Cape
Canaveral in June, destroyed a set of science
experiments meant to supplement the stories.
As always, there's a moral to these hard-luck
launch tales.
""One of the big takeaways from spaceflight is that it
takes a fair amount of patience and just
perseverance to make these things happen,"" said
Alvin Drew, the astronaut who kicked off the Story
Time project during space shuttle Discovery's final
flight in 2011.
A cool plot twist: Two of the seven picture books
going upŠ""Mousetronaut"" and ""Mousetronaut Goes
to Mars""Šwere written by a former astronaut whose
identical twin just happens to be spending a year in
orbit.
If Mark Kelly's books arrive at the space station by
year's end, his brother, Scott, should be able to
read them on camera before his one-year space
mission ends in March.
""It was such a neat opportunity,"" Story Time's
creator, Patricia Tribe, said of the Kelly brothers'
connection.
Also going up: ex-astronaut John (Danny) Olivas'
""Endeavour's Long Journey."" Author-astronomer
Jeffrey Bennett's latest children's book, ""I,
Humanity"" will join his dog-in-space Max series
already at the orbiting lab.

Two of the seven picture books going up for the
December 2015 ""Story Time from Space"" program,
""Mousetronaut"" and ""Mousetronaut Goes to Mars""Šwere
written by the former astronaut, Mark, whose identical
twin, Scott, just happens to be spending a year in orbit.

An English schoolboy will vicariously travel along
as well.
Seven-year-old Roraigh Curran of Chorley in
northwestern England won a contest by London-
based Lost My Name books. His prize: a
personalized version of ""The Incredible Intergalactic
Journey Home"" sent to the space station for a
reading.
The soon-to-be-space bound book shows satellite
views of Roraigh's hometown, even his street and
house, and stars in the sky spell out his
nameŠRoraigh's favorite part. At school, he's
already known as ""The Space Boy,"" according to
his father, Ciaran Curran.
""It's amazing,"" Roraigh said by phone this month. ""I
just like the fact that it's all about me!""
As part of the prize, he has been invited to the
books' launch from Cape Canaveral on Dec. 3. The
books will ride along with 7,000 pounds of 
space
station
 cargo.
Tribe said the beauty of the Story Time projectŠpart
of the nonprofit Global Space Education
FoundationŠlies in its simplicity.
""Everybody can relate to having books read to
them,"" she said by phone from British Columbia,
where she now lives.
Drew did his 2011 demo as a favor for Tribe, former
education director at Space Center Houston, the
tourist side of Johnson Space Center. She was
trying to get NASA on board.
He picked Bennett's ""Max Goes to the Moon,""
reading the story about the spacefaring dog from
his laptop in the cramped cockpit of Discovery.
Parents loved it, kids loved it and, yes, NASA loved
it, too, according to Drew.
""It was easy to go run with it after that,"" said Drew,
who's temporarily assigned to the White House
office of science and technology policy,
Next, NASA astronaut Michael Hopkins and
Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata read stories

 for RPA in the Law Industry  
        ""Get RPA in the 
door, ˜nd some key 
wins, and use that 
to gain momentum. 
Then it™s easy to 
get people in the 
business to listen.ﬂ  Š Blake Rooney,
       Chief Information O˚cer 
PROFILE ORGANIZATION
With headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, Husch Blackwell is a law 
˜rm of approximately 700 attorneys in 19 o˚ces across the U.S. The 
company delivers legal solutions coupled with business and industry 
insight to help clients address their most complex business challenges.  
CHALLENGE
A few operational areas inside the ˜rm were experiencing bottlenecks, 
as sta˛ had to perform time-consuming tasks to complete work. Some 
members of the company attended a conference where they learned 
about Robotic Process Automation (RPA), saw how automation 
technology was being used, and realized it made sense for their business. 
With use cases in mind, Husch Blackwell™s pipeline for automation ideas 
began to grow.
SOLUTION
Husch Blackwell talked with di˛erent companies about how they managed 
their bots before running its own proof-of-concept (POC) scenarios. 
Instead of focusing on easier processes, such as automating accounting 
invoices, which is often implemented ˜rst by other companies, the 
˜rm speci˜cally tailored its automation program to ˜t within the legal 
environment. This was something that had not been done before by any 
other ˜rm. After looking at scalability, security, and the departments that 
were mature enough to manage their own bots, Husch Blackwell began 
automating processes speci˜c to its law practice.

January 2020STORY DETAILS
One of the ˜rst bots implemented focused on the ˜rm™s con˝icts check 
process, which involves examining computerized lists of clients and 
cases to determine whether a lawyer has ever represented a party with 
con˝icting interests to the new clients. Automating this process as a set 
of bot tasks freed employees from scanning email or a database for the 
information needed. 
When one of the ˜rm™s managing attorneys expressed interest in getting 
information about potential litigation quicker, the RPA team ˜gured out a 
way to use a bot to scan a daily email the company received and highlight 
potential litigation. The bot then took the information and ran it against 
the ˜rm™s client list to pull out more information, such as the relationship 
manager assigned and when he or she last worked with the client. 
This digested information was then packaged into another email and 
distributed to the related internal department so that team could take a 
closer look at the likely prospects needing legal services. Although this bot 
is relatively new and the business impact hasn™t been measured yet, the 
potential of the bot to help the company obtain new business is expected to 
make a big impact. 
THE FUTURE
 Husch Blackwell is in the process of adopting IQ Bot, the only cognitive 
bot that incorporates vision skills to add structure to unstructured content 
with the ability to get more accurate over time. Once implemented, it will 
be able to process courthouse documents in di˛erent formats, extract 
needed information, and perform whatever automation is desired. Before 
IQ Bot, processing email attachments from di˛erent courts could take one 
person hours, if not days.
The ˜rm has 13 ideas in the automation pipeline, and its RPA team meets 
regularly to discuss which ideas have merit and the highest return on 
investment. Husch Blackwell is starting to investigate opportunities to 
improve ine˚ciencies in knowledge management, the area that helps 
retain and win new business. It also plans to send its process improvement 
and automation architect to o˚ces to keep evangelizing RPA and get 
employees excited about it.

ORGANIZATION PROFILE
Signify, formerly Philips Lighting, is the world leader in lighting for 
professionals, consumers and for the Internet of Things. Signify provides 
the customers with high-quality, energy-e˜cient lighting products, 
systems and services. With 2018 sales of •6.4 billion the company has 
29,000 employees and a presence in more than 70 countries. Infosys 
BPM has been providing Finance and Accounting services to Signify 
since 2007.
CHALLENGE
Signify was looking for ways to streamline and improve the performance 
of several processes, including balance sheet account reconciliations 
(RTR), purchase-to-pay (PTP), and credit and collections (C&C). Employees 
had to manually update system tools, reconcile reports, and upload 
documentation for support. These high-touch repetitive processes like 
reconciliations, cash application, payment validation, and report generation 
were very labor-intensive. 120 employees were required to complete 
these processes, including associates and team leaders who were 
responsible for performing them daily.
SOLUTION
Infosys, with its deep domain and technical expertise, identified 
 various automation opportunities within Signify, and partnered with 
 Automation Anywhere to automate Signify™s ˚nance functions. After 
 piloting its ˚rst bot and quickly experiencing success, Infosys leveraged 
 the Automation Anywhere RPA platform to scale the number of bots 
 across multiple processes in its ˚nance function, resulting in improved 
 first-time-right, faster procure-to-pay cycles and reduction in 
 reconciliations preparation lead time.  Leveraging RPA and analytics 
 tools within that platform, Signify standardized and streamlined  its 
 reporting process, giving employees valuable time to review real-time 
 data to  make more accurate strategic decisions. 
BENEFITS
""Automation and
  Robotization are
  fundamentally  changing service  delivery in ˚nance 
  for the better.""
  Š Eric Goessens,
        Partnership       Development Lead,
        Signify
STORY DETAILS
Signify began their RPA journey in 2017 with a pilot program, wherein 
Infosys enabled deployment of RPA from Automation Anywhere within 
the ˚nance domain. After achieving quick success, Signify automated 
many of their front-end ˚nance processes and have reaped signi˚cant 
bene˚ts, including lower costs, faster processes, improved quality and 
 higher job satisfaction.
For example, software bots now monitor each account daily, so 
 they can keep owners up-to-date on billing. If a customer doesn™t 
respond for seven days after a bill is sent, bots automatically generate 
a reminder letter using a prede˚ned standard template. These letters 
 are translated by the bots into appropriate languages so they can 
 be used throughout the world. If a dunning letter is required due to 
late payment of a bill, the bots send one, and then notify a human 
manager about the delinquent account. This has substantially 
enhanced cash ˛ow while freeing up resources to design innovative 
new sources of lighting.
THE FUTURE
After experiencing automation success, Signify is planning on further 
using Infosys' expertise to roll out Automation Anywhere RPA, to more 
of its ˚nance and master data management processes in the near 
future, to help automate their processes end-to-end.  RPA is expected 
to dramatically reduce the time and cost of performing basic tasks for 
both the front and back o˜ce.
