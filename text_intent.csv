 for RPA in the Law Industry  
        ""Get RPA in the 
door, ˜nd some key 
wins, and use that 
to gain momentum. 
Then it™s easy to 
get people in the 
business to listen.ﬂ  Š Blake Rooney,
       Chief Information O˚cer 
PROFILE ORGANIZATION
With headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, Husch Blackwell is a law 
˜rm of approximately 700 attorneys in 19 o˚ces across the U.S. The 
company delivers legal solutions coupled with business and industry 
insight to help clients address their most complex business challenges.  
CHALLENGE
A few operational areas inside the ˜rm were experiencing bottlenecks, 
as sta˛ had to perform time-consuming tasks to complete work. Some 
members of the company attended a conference where they learned 
about Robotic Process Automation (RPA), saw how automation 
technology was being used, and realized it made sense for their business. 
With use cases in mind, Husch Blackwell™s pipeline for automation ideas 
began to grow.
SOLUTION
Husch Blackwell talked with di˛erent companies about how they managed 
their bots before running its own proof-of-concept (POC) scenarios. 
Instead of focusing on easier processes, such as automating accounting 
invoices, which is often implemented ˜rst by other companies, the 
˜rm speci˜cally tailored its automation program to ˜t within the legal 
environment. This was something that had not been done before by any 
other ˜rm. After looking at scalability, security, and the departments that 
were mature enough to manage their own bots, Husch Blackwell began 
automating processes speci˜c to its law practice.

January 2020STORY DETAILS
One of the ˜rst bots implemented focused on the ˜rm™s con˝icts check 
process, which involves examining computerized lists of clients and 
cases to determine whether a lawyer has ever represented a party with 
con˝icting interests to the new clients. Automating this process as a set 
of bot tasks freed employees from scanning email or a database for the 
information needed. 
When one of the ˜rm™s managing attorneys expressed interest in getting 
information about potential litigation quicker, the RPA team ˜gured out a 
way to use a bot to scan a daily email the company received and highlight 
potential litigation. The bot then took the information and ran it against 
the ˜rm™s client list to pull out more information, such as the relationship 
manager assigned and when he or she last worked with the client. 
This digested information was then packaged into another email and 
distributed to the related internal department so that team could take a 
closer look at the likely prospects needing legal services. Although this bot 
is relatively new and the business impact hasn™t been measured yet, the 
potential of the bot to help the company obtain new business is expected to 
make a big impact. 
THE FUTURE
 Husch Blackwell is in the process of adopting IQ Bot, the only cognitive 
bot that incorporates vision skills to add structure to unstructured content 
with the ability to get more accurate over time. Once implemented, it will 
be able to process courthouse documents in di˛erent formats, extract 
needed information, and perform whatever automation is desired. Before 
IQ Bot, processing email attachments from di˛erent courts could take one 
person hours, if not days.
The ˜rm has 13 ideas in the automation pipeline, and its RPA team meets 
regularly to discuss which ideas have merit and the highest return on 
investment. Husch Blackwell is starting to investigate opportunities to 
improve ine˚ciencies in knowledge management, the area that helps 
retain and win new business. It also plans to send its process improvement 
and automation architect to o˚ces to keep evangelizing RPA and get 
employees excited about it.
""RPA empowers 
employees to do 
their jobs because 
it™s consistent, 
repeatable, audited, 
and acts as a force 
multiplier since they 
can do more.ﬂ
