"The storyOne of ﬁve major San Diego County government divisions, the Health and Human Services Agency o!ers the community a wide range of health and social programs, including aging and independence services, public health programs, and children’s services.",Case_Study
"To help with the administration of these programs, the agency uses CalWIN, a state-approved program.",Case_Study
"Supporting documents used to qualify every individual for various government assistance programs, like food stamps (the Supplemental Nutrition Program ),Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medical, and more were being transferred onto a digital format using EMC Documentum.",Case_Study
An integration challengeDigitizing supporting documents and using CalWIN had introduced a challenge: How to get the two programs to communicate with each other automatically?,Case_Study
"Without this piece of automation, an agent using CalWIN would have to take information from relevant forms, then look for supporting documents in another system, visually and manually verify it, and then provide the information to an applying individual.Computations and Permutations of the veriﬁcation process There was another requirement.",Case_Study
CalWIN supported over 500 di!erent forms.,Case_Study
"Based on the forms the agent was using for each case, certain combinations of ﬁelds needed to be veriﬁed.",Case_Study
"For example, if he was using Form A and Form B then social security and address ﬁelds needed to be veriﬁed in the supporting documents, whereas if he was using Form C and Form B then social security and driver’s license details needed to be veriﬁed.",Case_Study
"These complexities resulted in hundreds of business rules, making process automation imperative.",Case_Study
San Diego County chose Automation Anywhere to automate its extremely complex Health and Human Services processing and veriﬁcation functions.,Case_Study
Working with a legacy application – a non-invasive approach is really the only way Automation Anywhere’s in-house experts sat down to design a process that would serve SDC’s requirements.,Case_Study
"To integrate CalWIN with Documentum required signiﬁcant code changes to CalWIN but being a legacy application, code changes to CalWIN were really not an option.",Case_Study
Automation Anywhere’s non-invasive approach was the solution.,Case_Study
"This way, those setting up the automation could work with the application and automatically retrieve data without making changes to CalWIN itself.",Case_Study
Any other solution would have required programming or direct integration coding.,Case_Study
"Seamless execution on 2000 computers – SMART Automation Technology The agents all use di!erent computer conﬁgurations – so any solution would have to adjust to several parameters like screen sizes and resolutions, operating systems, and di!erent platforms including Citrix, and then run the automated tasks seamlessly on each computer.",Case_Study
"Automation Anywhere’s built-in SMART Automation Technology, designed with adaptability in mind, would make this doable.",Case_Study
It solved an ancillary issue as well: agents routinely opened multiple forms on the screen at once – and only the most recently opened was visible.,Case_Study
SMART Automation Technology captured data from all active and non-active windows.,Case_Study
"Project at-a-glance Challenge: Automating a complex, time-consuming veriﬁcation processes requiring a legacy application, a document management system, and a variety of corresponding business rules.",Case_Study
"Solution: A non-invasive automation process utilizing the front-end of both applications, and a system that completed all veriﬁcation requirements with the press of a single hotkey.",Case_Study
"Beneﬁts: Reduced costs and risks, faster turnaround for veriﬁcation, and fewer human errors.",Case_Study
"“ We evaluated many other products but we chose AA because of its ﬂexibility to integrate with legacy systems ...I would recommend AA for its ﬂexibility to integrate and automate processes of any kind.” - Vinesh Goyal, ECM Practice Director, Burntsand Corporation (Integrated solution provider, digitized ECM project for San Diego County)San Diego County - Health and Human Services AgencyAn Automation Anywhere Case_StudyGo be great.",Case_Study
Solution Design Automation Anywhere experts devised a solution to bridge the systemic communication gap.,Case_Study
"An agent would be able to bring up veriﬁcation documents from Documentum, using information from the CalWIN system, and launch the veriﬁcation process with a single hotkey.",Case_Study
“ Automation Anywhere made it possible to integrate a legacy system with Documentum without requiring any changes to the legacy system.,Case_Study
"Solution deployment was breeze and users loved the e!ciency they achieved using Documentum as backend for content repository.” - Vinesh Goyal, ECM Practice Director, Burntsand Corporation (Integrated solution provider, digitized ECM project for San Diego County)Automation Anywhere would look at the open forms on the agent’s screen, use the combination to decide veriﬁcation ﬁelds, identify relevant documents, and then pull up those documents from the ECM system for the agent.",Case_Study
"This would speed up the decision making, which in turn would translate to a seamless experience for the agent and the end user.",Case_Study
"BeneﬁtsThe county had over 2000 agents using this system, which translated to countless hours saved in veriﬁcation time alone.",Case_Study
The beneﬁts of automating these systems?• A non-invasive solution reduced costs and risk.,Case_Study
No additional resources were required for custom programming.,Case_Study
"And no code changes were needed for CalWIN or the EMC enterprise content management system, so no additional resources were required for modiﬁcations either.",Case_Study

"The 7-year-old won a contest by London-based Lost My Name books with the prize of a personalized version of ""The Incredible Intergalactic Journey Home"" sent to the space station in December 2015 for a reading.",Case_Study
"(Ciaran Curran via AP) Once upon a time, when NASA's shuttles were still flying, an astronaut read a children's story from space.",Case_Study
"Thus was born Story Time from Space, a program that takes bedtime stories to new heights in its effort to get children excited about science.",Case_Study
"The latest bundle of picture books, mostly about space, is scheduled to rocket to the International Space Station in just over a month, joining five bedtime stories already there.",Case_Study
"The astronaut readings are posted online, available at any time for children to see.",Case_Study
"The delivery, targeted for December, was delayed a year because of a Virginia launch explosion.",Case_Study
"Another launch accident, this one from Cape Canaveral in June, destroyed a set of science experiments meant to supplement the stories.",Case_Study
"As always, there's a moral to these hard-luck launch tales.",Case_Study
"""One of the big takeaways from spaceflight is that it takes a fair amount of patience and just perseverance to make these things happen,"" said Alvin Drew, the astronaut who kicked off the Story Time project during space shuttle Discovery's final flight in 2011.",Case_Study
"A cool plot twist: Two of the seven picture books going up—""Mousetronaut"" and ""Mousetronaut Goes to Mars""—were written by a former astronaut whose identical twin just happens to be spending a year in orbit.",Case_Study
"If Mark Kelly's books arrive at the space station by year's end, his brother, Scott, should be able to read them on camera before his one-year space mission ends in March.",Case_Study

"Husch Blackwell Paving the Way for RPA in the Law Industry PROFILE ORGANIZATION With headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, Husch Blackwell is a law firm of approximately 700 attorneys in 19 offices across the U.S.",Case_Study
The company delivers legal solutions coupled with business and industry insight to help clients address their most complex business challenges.,Case_Study
"Processes Automated • Conflict checks • Potential litigation alerts Industry Law Practice CHALLENGE A few operational areas inside the firm were experiencing bottlenecks, as staff had to perform time-consuming tasks to complete work.",Case_Study
"Some members of the company attended a conference where they learned about Robotic Process Automation (RPA), saw how automation technology was being used, and realized it made sense for their business.",Case_Study
"With use cases in mind, Husch Blackwell’s pipeline for automation ideas began to grow.",Case_Study
SOLUTION Husch Blackwell talked with different companies about how they managed their bots before running its own proof-of-concept (POC) scenarios.,Case_Study
"Instead of focusing on easier processes, such as automating accounting invoices, which is often implemented first by other companies, the firm specifically tailored its automation program to fit within the legal environment.",Case_Study
This was something that had not been done before by any other firm.,Case_Study
"After looking at scalability, security, and the departments that were mature enough to manage their own bots, Husch Blackwell began automating processes specific to its law practice.",Case_Study
"BENEFIT 100% Automated email alerts of potential clients 800 Hours saved annually 13 Automation ideas in the pipeline ""Get RPA in the door, find some key wins, and use that to gain momentum.",Case_Study
"Then it’s easy to get people in the business to listen.” — Blake Rooney, Chief Information Officer ""RPA empowers employees to do their jobs because it’s consistent, repeatable, audited, and acts as a force multiplier since they can do more.” — Gene D'Aversa, Director of Project Management IT STORY DETAILS One of the first bots implemented focused on the firm’s conflicts check process, which involves examining computerized lists of clients and cases to determine whether a lawyer has ever represented a party with conflicting interests to the new clients.",Case_Study
Automating this process as a set of bot tasks freed employees from scanning email or a database for the information needed.,Case_Study
"When one of the firm’s managing attorneys expressed interest in getting information about potential litigation quicker, the RPA team figured out a way to use a bot to scan a daily email the company received and highlight potential litigation.",Case_Study
"The bot then took the information and ran it against the firm’s client list to pull out more information, such as the relationship manager assigned and when he or she last worked with the client.",Case_Study
This digested information was then packaged into another email and distributed to the related internal department so that team could take a closer look at the likely prospects needing legal services.,Case_Study
"Although this bot is relatively new and the business impact hasn’t been measured yet, the potential of the bot to help the company obtain new business is expected to make a big impact.",Case_Study
"THE FUTURE Husch Blackwell is in the process of adopting IQ Bot, the only cognitive bot that incorporates vision skills to add structure to unstructured content with the ability to get more accurate over time.",Case_Study
"Once implemented, it will be able to process courthouse documents in different formats, extract needed information, and perform whatever automation is desired.",Case_Study
"Before IQ Bot, processing email attachments from different courts could take one person hours, if not days.",Case_Study
"The firm has 13 ideas in the automation pipeline, and its RPA team meets regularly to discuss which ideas have merit and the highest return on investment.",Case_Study
"Husch Blackwell is starting to investigate opportunities to improve inefficiencies in knowledge management, the area that helps retain and win new business.",Case_Study
